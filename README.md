# Movie Review Text Analysis

[Tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) analysis of 3 users from the Criticker review platform

The analysis works through looking at the words used by my brother and two of his friends who provide movie reviews on the website [Criticker](https://www.criticker.com/).

The analysis begins with looking at some summary statistics for each reviewer, including total word counts and number of reviews.

Then looks at the top 10 single words, bigrams as well as word relationships using network graphs and a sentence level sentiment analysis.
