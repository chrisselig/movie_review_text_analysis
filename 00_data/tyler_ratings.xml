  <summary>A unique cinematic journey, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; travels across enormous distances of both space and time. The story it tells is on the one hand about the collective adventure of human life on and off this planet. But it is also about something lying beyond the bounds of humanity, something lying in the true realms of the mysterious.</summary>
  <quote>It innovated, doesn't feel boring and genuinely scares me. The monolith terrifies me and the beginning does too. It is claustrophobic even though it takes place in space which could be infinite. My favourite Kubrick and necessary viewing.</quote>

  <summary>Fearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked, Gotham City's own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis' most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it's ever known before. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I love it, and the hate is unfounded. It feels like a comic book, whereas Nolan did not (and stop comparing the two! They're entirely different). The action was crunchy and intense, the music was wonderful outside of one misguided track and placement, Ben did great and so did Galdot. I understood everything that went on so I don't know where it's incoherent, and I think it has more depth than it's given credit for, but ultimately style over substance isn't actually a bad thing.</quote>

  <summary>Adonis Johnson never knew his famous father,world heavy weight champion Apollo Creed, who died before he was born. Still, there's no denying that boxing is in his blood, so Adonis heads to Philadelphia, the site of Apollo Creed's legendary match with a tough upstart named Rocky Balboa. Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo - the fierce rival who became his closest friend. (Rotten Tomatoes)</summary>
  <quote>Not the best Rocky movie (and yes, I have ranked all of them 100 because I have no objectivity) but it's awesome. Coogler brings a different feel to the franchise; it's grimmer but it still has moments of lightness. It's Jordan's best performance and Stallone is once again BRILLIANT as Rocky. The final boxing match is a short film in itself, like they all have been. Coogler brings his own flavour but keeps the Rocky spirit alive. It's hard not to feel way too many emotions during it.</quote>

  <summary>Under the tutelage of Rocky Balboa, newly crowned light heavyweight champion Adonis Creed faces off against Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago.</summary>
  <quote>Don't know where it ranks in the franchise but I have no objectivity towards Rocky movies or even a movie that doesn't necessarily star him but still includes him. Rocky follows a formula that I love but they generally throw in little twists and turns. Great performances, amazing musical cues, emotion, fights are a short film in themselves, some laughs, tension between the Dragos and Creed/Rocky. Makes you care about the Dragos because this franchise has made so many memorable characters.</quote>

  <quote>Takes the foundation that Begins built and perfected it.  Amazing acting all around. People say a lot about Ledger but what about the others? Eckhard, for example, was brilliant as Dent. This movie out-Heats Heat, so it works both as a crime drama and a superhero film.</quote>

  <summary>A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and adopts the alter ego Deadpool. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>100 because I'm not afraid to give 100s (I don't see them as meaning 'perfect') and because I adore Deadpool and they did Deadpool right. Reynolds is fantastic, the action is not the best of the Marvel movies (Ant-Man is, I said it) but it's still wholly inspired. However, it's easily the funniest of the bunch, and the best. If you think some of the jokes are cringeworthy, that's kind of the point: Deadpool doesn't shut up and not everything he says is brilliant. That's what I love!</quote>

  <quote>Shit yes. I'm tuned into Refn. I've only seen this and Valhalla Rising  and they've both been really different from one another and stylish, interesting, very cool. I was destined to like this... homages to Kenneth Anger, dedication to Jodorowsky, Ryan Gosling, the retro style (which is now artsy since it's not 1980). There are a lot of memorable moments in here, the violence is gruesome but not overdone. There are just a lot of interesting ideas in here... and they're all done really well.</quote>

  <quote>Yeah, maybe people will see that I gave it a 100 and think that it doesn't deserve it but I still think it deserves the credit it got before the backlash (and the anti-backlash... and the anti-anti backlash...). It's gripping, biting satire. It's funny, intelligent and there's great direction from Fincher. So sue me, it remains in the top 10 for me even though I've seen tons of other movies.</quote>

  <quote>Okay so it's not very scary, that's the negative if you want a horror. But if you don't care, this is absolutely batshit insane. Cheesy effects with some pretty awesome sets, awkward (awesome) music, but if you read about the production some of that stuff makes sense. I mean, the movie doesn't, but who cares, the movie is experimental and outrageous. There's never a dull moment. That one girl's disembodied lower half kicked a picture of a cat. That's not even the strangest part.</quote>

  <quote>The most fascinating Western I've ever seen. Right from the get go it's impressive, with a legendary opening scene. The imagery is very heavy handed but that's okay.

  <summary>Bruce Campbell stars as Ash, a hapless housewares clerk time-warped back to the Dark Ages by the demonic power of the Necronomicon. Now armed with only a '73 Oldsmobile, his trusty chainsaw and a 12-gauge double-barreled S-Mart shotgun, our knuckleheaded hero must battle vicious she-bitches, a diabolical Evil Ash and the relentless hordes of the medieval dead.</summary>
  <quote>It relies heavily on Campbell's charisma like the second one (and to a lesser extent the first) did, but that's fine because he's awesome. This is even less of a horror than Evil Dead 2, leaning way more into over the top action. I love how silly the franchise got, moving from a great horror flick to a medieval action movie. Lots of wonderful one-liners, fun action, inventiveness. Almost on par with Evil Dead 2, but so bonkers it's a must-watch.</quote>

  <quote>It's not quite the same 95 was Sicario was but this movie is amazing. Kubrick would be proud of this as it's super intelligent, yet also touches on some simplistic and emotional subjects. It's very meta because we ask what their purpose for being here is, but what is ours? They mentioned something about feelings/language, and Villeneuve embraces that; he's a master of mood more than anything, making you feel something with the droney music, the silence, everything.</quote>

  <quote>Oh look a Bergman masterpiece, and one that I could probably give 100. Bergman and Ullmann were powerhouses and their exchanges were mesmerizing, but everyone did well. For example: the look on Ullmann's face in the final exchange with her mom is genuinely haunting.This was emotional and beautiful, with a lot of emphasis on filming the faces of the actors/actresses, but also had some awesome imagery outside of the people. The colours, the shot of Liv walking to her house... brilliant.</quote>

  <quote>I'll rate this the same as IW but IW is better. IW smashed what we expect from the MCU. This gave us mostly what we expect from the MCU. Admittedly does MCU better than others. Some parts are too quick, it's funny but doesn't connect quite as much. But it was a thrill ride, didn't feel as long as it was, offered tons of great action and emotional moments. It's just not as daring which makes it feel slightly less special. It does trade in that for a decent exploration of trauma though.</quote>

Korine again perfectly realized his vision of something with breezy, intoxicating kinetic energy.

  <quote>I re-watched this because the first time I saw it I was exhausted. This is so, so good. Deakins is an unsung hero, Villeneuve has made the most beautiful movie of the year; a masterclass to the point that every shot could be a picture on a wall. The isolation/emptiness of many of the environments/scenes echoes the loneliness that the characters feel. Contemplative, intelligent, not boring upon a re-watch, excellent music. Sci-fi from a true auteur.</quote>

  <quote>The opening scene sets the tone: the first line &quot;I first tasted semen when I was 7&quot; is a funny and strange to start a film, but then the movie gets deadly serious for the rest. That's what this film does; an allegory of sacrifice told with seriousness but also with a dark comedy throughout. It ends like you may expect but it's powerful and Gleeson is great. Every pained expression on his face, every look of judgement or concern rings true. Great photography, wonderfully shot and haunting.</quote>

It's amazing that you have heard some of the classic lines so many times but then when you hear them delivered (mostly by Bogart), there's an entire emotional/cool depth to 'em that make them sound fresh. That's both a compliment to him and the script. Everything else about the movie is great. It's simple on the surface but it tells a classic romance about people in hard, oppressive times. Also, Ingrid is beautiful.</quote>

I don't know which one is better but I think it comes down to if you prefer the stronger comedy of the first or like that the second has better characters and some genuine emotion (what?).

  <quote>I have a bias towards experimental things so that helps explain the 95, but here's my justification: every now again there's a horror film that makes you feel like you've stumbled across something you shouldn't be seeing. This happens more with shorts, because it's harder to stretch that feeling out to a feature length, but this does it. No, I don't know what the fuck is going on, but the imagery worked. Also, the noise in the beginning portion is fantastic and terrifying, same with the end.</quote>

  <quote>Great performance by Gleeson. What makes it a great movie, besides him, is that the usage of witty comebacks and sass from everybody (especially Gleeson) seems to make fun of the premise of the movie without outright coming out and saying it. If that makes sense. Either way, it's just a funny movie.</quote>

  <quote>This is one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen. It's pretty light-hearted with a few darker, emotional moments, but it's the funniest movie of the year (as of writing this) and I really love the characters. It definitely differs from the comics in some ways but it's still a hell of a lot of fun, and everyone does a great job. The only minor problem is Ronin who isn't developed that well, but I had such a blast with the Guardians that it hardly matters. Great CGI, action, comedy, etc.</quote>

But this has higher highs than EWBOK... like the ending. The ending in this was incredible, and so soul-crushing. So I'm gonna wuss out and give them the exact same score because the quality here is so ridiculous.</quote>

  <quote>I can see the Vonnegut (my fave author) influence so I'm kind of biased. The narration is so Kurt it's incredible. The way it uses humour, bizarre images and a... tomato to dissect human right violations and just society in general is pretty much perfect. And not only that but it's ballsy as fuck, declaring &quot;God does not exist&quot; in the first 30 seconds. It was from that moment on I knew I'd love this because it was so in my face.</quote>

Effective at being anti-war without actually showing the fighting. The story is told with fractured images and there are a lot of cool ideas like putting a coo-coo sound over the Mosfilms logo instead of heroic music. This is classic Tarkovsky.

  <quote>Inventive action, a great soundtrack (that often compliments the action beautifully), great performances, an interesting plot. The character development is not surprising and they progress in ways you'd expect, but I'd argue it doesn't matter. Different styles of comedy (vulgar, cheesy, clever) all work. What the movie focuses on it succeeds in and the church scene will go down as one of the best scenes of the year. Right now, this is the movie to beat this year, only a few have a chance.</quote>

  <quote>Chalk me up as one of the few people who loooove this movie. I feel like I need to write a longer review to really get into why, because it is pretty out there and needs more explanation than a short criticker review can give. But to sum it up... allegorical movie where the meaning is more important than the plot, decent acting (though some is wonky), fantastic imagery, a clever script, some really fitting music (especially the ending). Some scenes really haunted me. Proyas succeeds again.</quote>

  <quote>Rarely does a movie that I was this excited for live up to those expectations but this did. There are a couple jokes that might have worked if I was a kid, but most of the humour did. It's a visually stunning fantasy movie in both animation and atmosphere, but what's most impressive is how you're watching it and you realize it's a pretty profound and beautiful look at memories and stories, made better by the fact that it's a dark, melancholy film that is basically for kids.

  <quote>Best X-Men movie since X2, but this is a different beast. It's a very personal tale that manages to touch on a view different relevant issues (like immigration obviously), while throwing in enough brutal Wolverine violence to be satisfying in that way as well. Stewart and Jackman are brilliant in their roles, as they always are, so I'd rather talk about how Keen is excellent; an actress who demonstrates acting ability well beyond her years. Also, yes, very sad, perfect ending too. The X cross!</quote>

  <quote>Updating my review... I actually upped it like 7 points to put it into that &quot;Amazing&quot; category, but to be honest I could even up it a few more. I think this is one of the more underrated movies in the last 15 years, no word of a lie. It was one of my absolute favourites as a kid and I still appreciate it. It was smart, Ethan Hunt is a great character, Cruise did awesome, and it was a spy movie that didn't have tons of action (not like MI:2 does), and the action was more intense because of it.</quote>

  <quote>It's nice to see Nirvana again, and -- due to their philosophy, their music, their attitudes, their performances, etc -- to remember how lucky the mainstream was to have a band like them.

Maybe it could be a little more cohesive, like someone else said, but I think, at least in my case, me agreeing with that would be me splitting hairs, because this succeeds in showing who Nirvana were.</quote>

  <summary>Toshiaki Nagashima is a biologist who is doing major research on mitochondria. When his beautiful young wife is tragically involved in a car accident which leaves her brain dead, in desperation he steals her liver from her body in order to recieve the mitochondria from it to resurrect his wife from the dead. The killer mitochondria takes the form of his assistant who then uses the biologist for the host of a terrifying new species that is threatening to take over the world. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I've been in love with Parasite Eve since I played the game. I've read the book and now I've watched the movie. I'll probably be the only person ever to actually consider this movie a modern classic but there you go. Superb lighting and camera work that helps build a great atmosphere. The special effects are kind of cheap but people catch on fire. There are some real haunting scenes as well.</quote>

  <summary>A couple are driving home to their kids when their car runs out of gas just as the Purge commences. Meanwhile, Leo goes out into the streets to get revenge on the man who killed his son, and a mother and daughter run from their home after assailants destroy it. The five people meet up as they attempt to survive the night in Los Angeles. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I like it more than the original because instead of a horror movie they just decided to make it a mixture of Escape from New York and The Warriors (in terms of there being different, silly groups of people). Because of this, it was a lot of fun. The social commentary is very heavy-handed and at one point perhaps a little too blunt, even for me, but at least it was there. I think this will end up being a flick I deem &quot;underrated&quot; in years to come.</quote>

  <quote>This will be hard to beat this year. Expertly made in all ways, from the acting (Blunt and Krasinski are both awesome), the direction, the usage of Villieneuvian drone-y music and silence. It's tense from the very beginning and never relents. But above all else, it's incredibly heartfelt and emotional; a quality that a lot of horrors don't have.</quote>

  <quote>Brilliant. The music (especially that one drone-y song) just adds to the sense of overwhelming dread that is prevalent and suffocating throughout. Villeneuve lets the camera linger longer on a shot than most directors today, and he made Mexico a genuinely frightening character in itself, where you can't trust anything or anybody. Great performances around (especially my girl Blunt), with an intelligent script. Plus that abrupt ending... oh my god, yes.</quote>

  <quote>When it has to be emotional, it hits hard without becoming a vanity project. It moves along at a brisk pace, covers a lot of ground, and is never boring. The music benefits greatly from hearing the N.W.A tracks in a theatre, because it makes it feel larger and more important, and I have to give it up to the actors who portray N.W.A, because even though they're newcomers, they brought this wonderful script to life in a convincing fashion. Any flaws that exist here are slight and inconsequential.</quote>

Such a beautiful and expressive colour palette, brutal when it needed to be but not like I expected. Hang some of these scenes on your wall, it looks that good. Creepy and brilliant music, but then Argento would strip it away suddenly in some scenes and leave the tension of minimalist sound to do the rest. Scary, intense, story is told well with some fun twists.</quote>

An amazing performance by everyone, especially Shannon who I really like anyway. It's got some surrealism, beautiful visuals, an interesting sci-fi premise-meets-psychological drama going on. It's terrifying when it tries, deeply emotional as well. Great ending, a lot to think about, masterfully crafted. Just wow.</quote>

  <quote>Enough has been said about Daniel Day-Lewis. The story itself works on multiple levels. The music is loud and abrasive, often to the point of excess, along with sometimes seeming out of place. I think that is the point because often the music drives ahead at full force while the action on the screen is slowed down. The editing is pitch perfect, building tension the entire time. The ending is both hilarious and tragic, making the movie work as both a dramatic character study and black comedy.</quote>

  <quote>Fuck. This is a deeply sad short. We watch an old man swim down through his building, which has been flooded like the rest of his town, and we see him relive some of his most precious memories. While they are happy in spirit, they're bittersweet because of his solitude, having only the memories of his once eventful life. The metaphor of the submerged building (and having to build layers on to survive) is not exactly subtle, but it is incredibly potent. Fuck, again.</quote>

But the music is used amazingly in other scenes as well. Aside from that, beautiful imagery throughout with fantastic staging and camera work, cinematography. There's an intimacy here because of the way Mizoguchi used black and white, almost feels like it's too personal to watch. The plot also takes a few interesting turns.</quote>

  <quote>I think I just love these movies. It's the same formula as the first, but unlike a movie like The Hangover, it doesn't overstay its welcome for me. I laughed a lot and love the credit sequence. The only minor dig is that sometimes the excessive swearing is not that funny... it doesn't do it for me. But in a movie that has more than just excessive swearing, it's not as noticeable, and 22 Jump Street has a lot to fall back on. Very good chemistry between the two as well.</quote>

  <quote>Am I the highest ranking here? Perhaps so. Anyway, I adore this movie and view it (both plot, obviously and less obviously, characters) as an allegory for something much deeper than a lot of mainstream stuff, both politically and psychologically. It's not the deepest movie ever, don't get me wrong, but I appreciate the fact you can think about it. Besides that, some great animation, great scenery (sucker for this stuff), and some genuinely memorable scenes.</quote>

  <summary>An assassin hides out in Italy for one last assignment.</summary>
  <quote>Thought this was a pretty great movie. It wasn't what I expected. I loved watching how an assassin lives day to day. What really got to me was the paranoia. I've never been an assassin (heh, heh) or anything, but I imagine this movie shows just how one would feel. Clooney is fantastic, his facial expressions tell so much. I also loved how there's very little backstory, it throws you in the here and now and lets you examine the situation without saying much.</quote>

  <quote>The first was a pleasant surprise that was a little slow at the beginning, but this got right into it. Before the action got heavy it was one of the funniest flicks of the year, and the action--as with the first--was inspired: the big/small dynamic coupled with phasing made for some pretty exciting fights, and neither movie gets the credit they deserve for that. Rudd is Rudd, he's so amazing, I still think he's one of the main reasons these movies work so well. Ava's a good &quot;villain.&quot;</quote>

  <quote>I'm never having sex again. I don't know what it all means but this movie can get by on just being gorgeous. The images are full of such beauty and intrigue that you keep watching. But the acting was also great and the music is fitting (even in the credits). I like the artwork when the new chapters show up. This is a really daring, original and disgusting movie. The plot is pretty minimal but the symbolism is pretty heavy.</quote>

  <quote>The kids did a wonderful job. While some sections of the movie were more funny than others (the middle area was HILARIOUS, the rest of the jokes were more scattered in the other sections), the movie also works with some good action pieces, good music and interesting alien designs. The final run is epic as hell. Like someone said, there's even some social commentary in there once in a while. This movie succeeds at everything it sets out to do, and it succeeds admirably.</quote>

  <quote>You HAVE to put it down for Wallis, who at such a young age carries the film. Believe me, there's a lot of film to carry: this is a masterfully done work of art.

There are no dragons (though there are beasts), but what makes it is the imagination of the world. This is the South like you've never seen. Emotional, complex, driven home by an incredible final 10 or 15 minutes.</quote>

It has great action, a great script and above all else... fantastic imagery. It also helps that it's smarter than a typical action movie and blends western elements in with a post-apocalyptic world.

It has some laughs, lots of cries, treats its themes and subjects with respect and intelligence. An excellent meditation on death and family.</quote>

But whatever, it's a fun and atmospheric monster movie with great underwater scenes and scary music for the creature. Can be a little tense at times. I really love this.</quote>

  <summary>Based on the novel of the same name by Ladislav Fuks the film centers around a truly chilling lead performance by Rudolf Hrusinsky as the demonic, death obsessed Karl Kopfrkingl. (Amazon.co.uk)</summary>
  <quote>The opening moments set the stage here, showcasing the offbeat nature of the film, the way the cinematography and flash images come together to demonstrate a pretty twisted guy. Karl is merely creepy and death obsessed at the beginning, but then when he is introduced to Nazism then he suddenly has an ideology that he can utilize his &quot;talents.&quot; The last half is truly demented and scary (not in a modern horror way), but the first is pretty straightforward. Excellent soundtrack too.</quote>

  <quote>Sometimes I have a hard time reviewing documentaries because I'm less interested in how it's shot than I am the information that it gives. Obviously telling your narrative in a compelling way helps, but I look more for docs to break ground, shine light on issues that might not be known. Because of my criticism of the system in which police operate this is a must-see in my eyes, and this does a great job of getting two different but related stories across.</quote>

  <quote>There wasn't a moment that I didn't enjoy this movie, and for a lot of it I can honestly say I was in love with it. The beginning, before all the combat starts, is well-written and emotional. It's not the deepest social commentary in the world but it's done incredibly, and it's hard not to feel things... all the time. I was surprised with how much it turned me into a little baby. When the fighting happened it was good, but the highlight is before all that.</quote>

  <quote>Definitely a great concept, and the movie definitely touches on multiple themes and ideas. I'm not sure the amount of depth the movie really puts into exploring the ideas but at the very least it briefly touches on things and that's good. I wish they would have expanded the beginning and had less action, but even so the action scenes were inspired and very entertaining, taking some things that could be cringe worthy and making them awesome. A great flick.</quote>

  <quote>A pretty straight forward Cronenberg gangster flick. I like this direction for him. He's done the body horror, now he's dealing with a seedy underworld. Viggo and Naomi (doesn't hurt that I have the hots for her) all turn in wonderful performances and there is some gritty realism here. The twists and turns are interesting and never seem forced, all building towards a wonderful climax. Plus, the shower scene. Wow.</quote>

Fisher puts in really good work, bringing this character to life extraordinarily well, obviously helps that she is basically the age of her character. It's a really emotional and honest movie, maybe even a little uncomfortable. Awesome music too.</quote>

  <quote>Loved it but it's heavily dependent on the performances, specifically Washington and David, but everybody else was believable. That's important because this ends up being one of those movies where you almost forget you are watching something, because everybody is so invested in these characters that it's easy to become invested yourself. I don't understand some of the criticisms because this is fantastic and raw filmmaking. It's just always nice to see Denzel though, so there's bias on my part.</quote>

  <quote>Ever since The Purge changed from cool-premise-but-okay-first-film to a horror-tinged action series I have become a massive fan. I just love it: masks, ridiculous action, craziness, that feeling of creepiness without outright being a horror movie, the overt and militant political commentary (because that is okay sometimes, especially in regards to class war). Admittedly this is a bit of a step back from the previous two, but I still loved it. I'm all in on this series.</quote>

  <quote>Awesome. I was most surprised by how invested I was in the characters. Browning could have just played it all for shock value (which, in '32 it woulda been shocking), but he didn't. There's real heart here, and the drama between them all is fascinating. That doesn't mean that there aren't some eerie parts though, like the chase in the rain at the end. To the credit of all involved, that tonal shift actually worked.</quote>

  <summary>A female cyborg cop and her partner hunt a mysterious and powerful hacker called the Puppet Master (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Beautifully animated with great action when it happens (that tank scene is wonderful and a clear influence on something else I love, Metal Gear Solid). It asks heavy questions about sex/gender and identity, in a blunt way that is a bit confusing regardless. It could probably use more exposition to explain the world that it has set up, but I got the general idea. I give special attention to the music which actually added a lot to the scenes.</quote>

  <quote>It gave me what I wanted. It feels different than every other superhero movie; it's a decidedly slow burn, but it was interestingly so, a nice psychological breakdown of these characters. But it also was a little unpredictable, and the plot twists were satisfying. He knew enough not to give Bruce too many lines because he'd phone it in, and gave McAvoy most of the heavy lifting. Fight scenes were gritty and that made sense. Just intrigued by this the entire time.</quote>

  <quote>We know Godzilla didn't happen and yet it felt like it did. This is because of Japan losing a war earlier but also an unintentional effect of black and white cinema; sometimes it just makes it feel more historical and intimate. Anyway, great score, fun visuals for the time that are still neat to examine today due to how cool they were, grim atmosphere, some beautiful shots/scenes, potent social commentary and of course Godzilla himself is a legend.</quote>

  <quote>Stevens was awesome in the lead; so charming. The movie itself is 80s like Drive (but campier), with its style (especially later on) and badass synth soundtrack, but it's also compelling because it goes from a tense thriller, to a minor Sci-Fi government conspiracy movie, to a campy, slasher flick. It's sure to not please everybody, especially as it goes straight 80s later on, but the mixture of tone, influences and genres worked hard for me.</quote>

  <quote>In minimalist thrillers like these you really need to rely on the actor because he/she has to carry it and carry it Cedergren does. But that's not to say that the rest of it isn't great because it has a polished script with very few inconsistencies/stupid parts and enough twists and turns to be both interesting and heart-wrenching. Special props to the sound; a lack of music so when it hits at the end it feels earned, not to mention when people hang up the silence afterwards aches.</quote>

  <quote>The first hour or so is mostly a really compelling drama about loss and a family falling apart, outside of some ominous music and atmosphere. Because of this, it earns its dread later. I love the way Aster filmed this, mirroring the family with the miniatures, the transitions and camera angles used to do so, to make the house a character. The ending is almost played off as happy/triumphant but is actually the worst thing that could ever happen to the world, great stuff. Collette was amazing.</quote>

Seriously, this film is gorgeous and nails everything it sets out to do. I might up this to a 95 in the future.</quote>

  <quote>One could enjoy this just based on the &quot;wtf&quot; that it makes you feel, but there are a lot of weird movies. Holy Motors has some incredible scenes, such as the rendition of Let My Baby Ride, or the ending (it made me laugh). That's the thing, for as odd as it is, and for how great the premise is, there is a point here (I don't entirely know what it is, I just know it's there, maaan). It uses music well, and the vignettes range from weird, to heart wrenching to violent... and it does it easily.</quote>

He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel's superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing -- the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.  A small village is about to get some big city justice.  (Rogue Pictures)</summary>

  <quote>Definitely belongs to another time, or at least in a different category of horror movie than audiences are used to these days: meaning that it's more creepy than outright scary.

This is effective but it's interesting, has great performances, looks wonderful and showcases Bergman's talent in a completely different genre than we're accustomed to seeing him in.</quote>

  <quote>Like Hero before it I'm surprised by how invested I was in the story. I came for the martial arts, where it certainly delivered both in choreography and how beautiful the film is, but the cherry on top was that I found the plot both interesting and heartfelt. This is more romance than Hero was, but because of that the final fight was actually really emotional and brutal. But even if you just judge it based on how wuxia it is, it succeeds admirably.</quote>

  <quote>Knowing nothing about the real case I didn't know what to expect. I liked the premise and wanted to see what came from it.

It draws you into the world of a pathological liar/identity theft, goes from being a gripping tale of a family and loss to a true-crime movie. Like his identity, you're left wondering what the truth is in all of this, what happened to Nicholas?</quote>

  <quote>The McDonagh brothers both seem to nail dark comedy like no one else in the business, or at the very least they are up there. In Bruges is quite funny at times, but also doubles as a legit crime drama as well. Spoilers, but when the kid gets shot that is actually harrowing. So it ends up being more emotional than one might expect while also bringing the goods on the humour front. Gleeson is made for the McDonagh writing and while I don't like Farrell so much, he's charming here.</quote>

  <summary>After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life.</summary>
  <quote>I might make the argument that despite rating them the same, this is a little better than the first. The first had the novelty of being a big surprise, but this ups it in the sense that there is a bigger threat (spoiler: all those other killers being let loose on him). It's more of the same, which is great; excellent mixture of gun and martial arts violence, little details like how he &quot;jabs&quot; his gun to be more aggressive are still there. Awesome.</quote>

  <quote>I'm just going to go ahead and rate this the same as the others (90 but could be a 95) because to be honest I can't tell the difference. That's not a criticism because the action is so inventive and exciting. This is just an awesome action franchise. There were some really expertly done scenes here outside of just the choreography as well, so that was nice.</quote>

The violence works, it's appropriately dark and nihilistic--almost disturbing at times--and the plot moves at a great pace; never boring or uninteresting.</quote>

  <quote>Sometimes it's cheesy but that doesn't really matter to me. The action is great with its buckets of blood. I could say that maybe the story could use a little bit of tightening up because it's a tad confusing but it seems silly to say that when the movie is just so much fun. I don't really go into this genre or any revenge movie for an amazing story. This has a bunch going on in it but ultimately it just has to lead to action to satisfy. And it does.</quote>

This is disturbing, it builds and builds, and the visual style (the 'hand held' style that makes it look like real footage) is perfect for this. I can't watch this again, but when I was watching it I was really involved. I was grossed out, the characters felt genuine (props to the lead actresses) and I felt awful. It shook me to my core.

  <quote>Continuing on with my boner for Tarkovsky, here comes the Mirror. This is a confusing film with a lot going on. It takes place in 3 different times and just kind of randomly switches back and forth. It's loosely autobiographical. It uses childhood memories, newsreel footage and poems by his father. It uses colour in a really interesting way. It has dreamlike qualities and it focuses a lot on the beauty of what it's shooting.</quote>

I want to give this a 95, and maybe later on I will, but this is exactly what one should expect from both the series and action movies. Awesome stunts/action set pieces, charm and a hell of a lot of plot swerves... did I want anything else? Nope. So while it plays it safe, technically, it delivers on all fronts. This is in large part to the dedication to both craft and character that Cruise constantly displays.</quote>

  <quote>Oh my god I love this. It's really really intelligent, and really original. It's surreal, it's complicated, it does a bunch of cool little things and effects. But what catapults it beyond just &quot;a neat little gimmicky (I'm not saying gimmicky as a bad thing) film&quot; is the emotion. I laughed a bunch of times, but when it came down to it, the movie knew how to make me sad. Wonderful performances, an interesting story... even though I can't say with 100% authority that I understand it (I think I do).</quote>

  <summary>A drama centered on two teenage boys who encounter a fugitive and pact to help him escape from an island in the Mississippi. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's slow-paced but beautiful, with the scenery pretty much being a character by itself. Luckily Mud and Ellis are compelling leads, and the rest of the cast fleshes out the rest of the backbone of the movie. McConaughey gives a wonderful performance (and still manages to take off his shirt), and when the shit hits the fan at the end, it's more intense because of the tone of the rest of the film. It's hard to not feel something by the end.</quote>

  <quote>Can you imagine this back in 1955? I think that back then it would be more shocking but that doesn't mean it can't make an impact even today, that's how good it is. The narration is pitch perfect in describing it, even though he says he basically can't describe it. That, along with the images of both past and -- at the time -- present, this is a really great documentary and should be necessary viewing in History courses.</quote>

  <quote>Worthy of its praise. Treats its subject matter, characters and spiritual with respect, crafting a beautiful yet violent fantastical tale of human vs nature. They could have cheaped out and painted everything as good vs evil, leaving it as black and white, but like the abundance of colours that permeate the screen, it's more complex than that. Of course the animation is superb, but that almost goes without saying. I also just loved the ending with the little forest spirit doing its thing.</quote>

Not as good as the second but still wonderful trashy entertainment.</quote>

  <quote>The plot actually helped for me because as much as I loved the first, I like a glue to keep it together. The betrayals and little twists were enough to keep me interested, but let's not kid ourselves: the first movie and now this one offer some of the best pure action you will see in a movie these days. The martial arts action is insane, like they're trying to outdo themselves with each unique fight. There's also a charm to the fact that the gun play is minimal, even in full-scale gang war.</quote>

There is some minor social commentary here, for sure, but it has taken a backseat to the action which is some of the finest I've seen in recent years. It gets less exciting later on, but the beginning bit is amazing. Sure, with stronger characters it'd be better... but enjoy it for what it is. Intense martial arts action.</quote>

  <quote>A great reflection on privacy but also a good character study. It starts off pretty lighthearted, but then becomes more grave as it goes on. An excellent mystery movie that employs a lot of Hitchcock trademarks and his storytelling formula, but does so remarkably. Also, the direction is top notch, and the use of sound is extraordinary. Sound itself is really a character, which is so rare, the absence of it can be felt and things can be tense without a word really spoken.</quote>

  <summary>A horror film in which a group of misfits encounter fundamentalism gone to the extreme in Middle America.</summary>
  <quote>It's militant satire. The beginning really over stressed the gay elements of the movie. Then the script worked itself out. It goes from horror to action, and there's some comedy thrown in. I always like Goodman, Parks was great. The tone is unsettling, there are a lot of twists that I liked. It was unpredictable with some nicely done deaths. It's darin' cuz Smith didn't restrain himself at all. I like the trumpet part. And the explanation to it. Lack of soundtrack was interesting.</quote>

  <summary>The workers of a dye factory have their pay cut by 20% when the factory owner brings in some Manchu thugs to try and increase production. Desperate to reclaim their full wages, the workers hire an actor to impersonate a priest and kung-fu expert from the temple of Shaolin. (IMDB)</summary>
  <quote>I'm gonna be honest, I actually like this one more than the first film a by a little bit because the comedy actually did make me laugh. It follows a similar pattern to the first film, but it riffs on it a little bit, it makes the main character a bit of an idiot. But I was entertained by it, and while it's not as bloody/violent, the choreography is just as solid here, which makes the final battle incredibly exciting.</quote>

  <summary>Hitman Jeff Costello is a perfectionist who always carefully plans his murders and who never gets caught. One night however, after killing a night-club owner, he&amp;amp;#039;s seen by witnesses. His efforts to provide himself with an alibi fail and more and more he gets driven into a corner. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I can definitely see the influence that this movie has had on many other movies. Gotta give props to Delon for portraying the very cool Jeff. Also, the way the movie portrays loneliness and solitude is astounding. While the actual plot is nothing spectacular, especially these days, it's told extremely well. When a movie so perfectly tackles its theme, it's hard not to love it.</quote>

  <quote>This movie succeeds because they used their low budget to their advantage, thinking up an idea that heavily revolves around not having the money to make expansive set pieces. Two guys in a room. Very little gore, an interesting villain (if slightly offbase), decent enough performances that are only sometimes poor, a creepy score and an excellent plot twist. See this, you don't really need the other 84392. (Predicting the future, y'see.)</quote>

  <quote>Everything in this is done well and I can't find a glaring flaw. The exchanges between Foster and Hopskins are so obviously the star here that I actually wish we had gotten more of them, but that's more of just wanting a great thing rather than a criticism... though I think more would make a better film. It's eerie, intelligent, haunting, and the ending only pushes those feelings forward. Not an absolute fave of mine but still amazing, worthy of its status.</quote>

In an attempt to convert Luke to the dark side, Darth Vader lures young Skywalker into a trap in the Cloud City of Bespin. In the midst of a fierce lightsaber duel with the Sith Lord, Luke faces a startling revelation. (20th Century Fox)</summary>
  <quote>Improvement on A New Hope in every way. Better script, action, music, no weak links in acting, more character development... the darker tone is nice. Darth Vader getting more time to shine is only ever a good thing, and they upped the ante quite a bit for Return, while still being a good movie on its own. There are times in SWs that the light sabre battles feel hollow but not the case here. Film makers today should keep in mind that THIS is how you do the &quot;in-between&quot; movie in a trilogy.</quote>

Will Darth Vader and the dark side overcome the rebels and take over the universe ? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Star Wars sometimes rides that line between a little childish and more mature and dark. Empire was mostly dark, but this does a little bit of both. While I don't think the more lighthearted parts, like Endor, are bad, they're not what Return does best. I almost rated it a 95 though because of the last little while with Luke and Vader... riveting stuff. Besides that, just another great sci-fi flick, same elements as the previous two in the original trilogy. This is my second fave.</quote>

I like how he isn't caught up with being too PC. Great musical cues abound. You never really know what's going to happen.</quote>

Also has great cinematography, that really showcases the symbolism. Loaded heavily with subtle metaphors for liberty and other things. Acting was great. Some adult material. Can be a little depressing however it is also uplifting in the way that music mends her. A careful meditation on art, such as music.

  <summary>Journalist David Farrier stumbles upon a mysterious tickling competition online. As he delves deeper he comes up against fierce resistance, but that doesnt stop him getting to the bottom of a story stranger than fiction. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Like Dear Zachary or The Imposter, this is a documentary that ends up being a bit of a thriller, due to the unexpected twists and turns. Within the first 5 minutes (when Farrier gets an email criticizing him for being gay, while the person defended tickling) I was hooked, and it just kept getting deeper and deeper. A pretty haunting look into abuse and threats in an online space, and the pathos of a twisted individual. Doesn't go into much detail about the fetish itself, so don't expect it to.</quote>

  <summary>Dislocation in time, time signatures, time as a philosophical concept, and slavery to time are some of the themes touched upon in this nine-minute, experimental film, which was written, directed, and produced by Jim Henson-and starred Jim Henson! Screened for the first time at the Museum of Modern Art in May of 1965, Time Piece enjoyed an eighteen-month run at one Manhattan movie theater and was nominated for an Academy Award for outstanding short subject.

  <summary>In this experimental film, Isidore Isou, the leader of the lettrist movement, lashes out at conventional cinema and offers a revolutionary form of movie-making: through scratching and bleaching the film, through desynchronizing the soundtrack and the visual track, through deconstructing the story, he aims to renew the seventh art the same way he tried to revolutionize the literary world. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>You couldn't watch movies like this all the time, because it is quite obnoxious like FitForDanga said. I differ though because I thought this was an extremely interesting, engaging flick because it is a one off. The Letterist philosophy is revolutionary, no matter how cocky Isou himself is. There's too much to say in a short review box like this, but in short, it's not technically enjoyable and is an anti-film. If every movie followed the ideas it'd just be a normal movie, but not every film is.</quote>

The horse is old and in very poor health, but does its best to obey its master's commands.

  <quote>If u have seen a Tarr film, you know what to expect: slow, long takes, heavy themes. As I watched this, it didn't instantly grab me like Werckmeister Harmonies did, but afterwards I felt similar... like now it will weigh heavily on me. This is what Tarr is good at. Even if u don't instantly recognize it; the cinematography, dialogue, constant darkness, the poetry of the visuals and the pacing, the music... it has already taken a hold of you and it's not going to let go.</quote>

  <quote>Here's an idea: Make a documentary about one of the most dominant and interesting boxers the world has ever seen. Then base it all around him and his views. You would expect it to be insanely one sided but it's not because Tyson is as honest as he is fascinating. He speaks about his flaws and his accomplishments, never giving himself more or less than he deserves. You can't help but feel sympathetic towards him sometimes, and you can't help but believe what he says.</quote>

That's not saying the skill isn't there, but if you're not in the right mood, you won't be entertained. You know what you're getting with Korine... broken or non-existent narrative, beautiful (very underrated by haters) cinematography and a lot of WTF? This is more of the same.

  <quote>M. Night Shyamalan will never make a better movie. Yes, there is a twist here but even if you know it the movie still works really well because it's an affective character study of a man on his way to great things. However, there are a few plot holes/questions concerning the whole thing, but it's best to not think about them because it's not that important. The score, especially song titled Unbreakable is astounding.</quote>

Told entirely from a young girl's computer desktop, Cybernatural redefines 'found footage' for a new generation of teens. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The gimmick works tremendously well so we should be encouraging filmmakers to take a chance on things like this, even if the concept might only be good as a one-and-done. Besides that, the relationships between the main characters are emotional and believable. Unfriended doesn't overuse tacky jump scares, but instead focuses on creeping you out. The few flaws that exist are slight. The humor works, and there are some incredibly memorable scenes.</quote>

  <quote>This movie is what Randal (in Clerks) criticizes Lord of the Rings for: people walking. That's what you get mostly, except for a few violent fight scenes that are quick but kind of gross. The cinematography is astounding and really gives the rather tedious events an air of importance, and the movie doesn't really tell you a lot so you're left wondering afterwards what everything means. One Eye is a badass, and the ending is a WTF, but it feels like it fits.</quote>

  <quote>A slight step down from Dawn but still awesome. Serkis was incredible as Caesar yet again, the action sequences worked well, and there was a lot of intelligence and emotional depth. The POW camp was harrowing but if I had to level a criticism, albeit a tiny one, it's that maybe it took a bit of a dip during that period, which maybe prevents it from being a 95. Excellent direction/cinematography elevated it to a higher level. This trilogy is awesome.</quote>

  <quote>Upon more careful thought I've given it a lower score. The flaws are relatively minor and don't really subtract from the overall experience very much. Everything makes perfectly thematic sense, such as the &quot;odd&quot; choice of music. It's serious and ridiculous and because of that it's challenging. It embodies both of those things so it has to polarize people. Also, knowing the comic helped me like it but I didn't nitpick either. Guess this is another case of me being easier on films.</quote>

There's a certain standard that kids movies are held up to, &quot;oh, it's good for a childrens flick,&quot; but this movie is more proof that childrens flicks don't have to be shit.</quote>

  <quote>What a beautiful little doc, one that is very singular in its quest and vision. No, there isn't some secret life of Mr. Rogers, nor does the film spend much time on negativity: it touches on it but like Rogers himself, it spends its time dealing with it and combating it on an intelligent and sympathetic way. I've forgotten a lot of what the show did so it was nice to see how it tackled all these issues. But you come to this doc to feel good, and in that sense it is just like his show/life.</quote>

  <summary>Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Gal puts in a really great performance here, and Pine was well suited for this role. While I look forward to seeing WW back in a contemporary setting, this was a great origin story, full of emotion and even some laughs (something that DCEU movies lack). Closer to, but darker than, a typical Marvel movie, this should strike a good balance for those who feel BvS was too oppressively dark. Some great action sequences, specifically when her theme first hits. Still not tired of superheroes.</quote>

  <summary>The highly anticipated follow-up to Don Hertzfeldt's WORLD OF TOMORROW finds Emily Prime swept inside the brain of an incomplete back-up clone of her future self, who's on a mission to reboot her broken mind. Continuing the tradition of the first film, WORLD OF TOMORROW EPISODE TWO was written entirely around candid audio recordings of the director's five year old niece. (bitterfilms.com)</summary>
  <quote>I don't think it quite hits the level of the first episode for me so I won't give it a 95. With that said, it's a high 90 that is well on its way to 95 and is one of the finer short films ever released. It uses the same gimmick (making up a story around the dialogue of his niece) and gives us a mindbusting exploration of some pretty heavy themes... presented to us with his typical brand of great humour and animation.</quote>

Meanwhile, Shoji Yamanaka (Kinya Kitaoji) is an ambitious criminal who quickly scales the hierarchy of the Muraoka family, but his fall proves as sudden as his ascent. (All Movie Guide)</summary>
  <quote>An improvement on the original because of more focus, less characters -- thus meaning more attention paid to the ones that exist -- and better violence. It's still a little confusing at times because there are still quite a few people, but you get the gist of it eventually. The violence is still incredibly gory and almost disgusting at times, and watching these alliances form and crumble is a treat. Chiba is incredible as an over-the-top killer who is a complete badass.</quote>

  <summary>Kinji Fukasaku's violent chronicle of mob warfare in post-war Hiroshima continues with this, the third film in the Yakuza Papers series. Shozo Hirono (Bunta Sugawara) struggles to remain independent and neutral in the midst of an ongoing battle between two mob families, but his drams of brokering a balance between them are dashed when a crime syndicate from Kobe enters the picture. (All Movie Guide)</summary>
  <quote>So far I've rated these pretty consistently, with the first being lower because it's ridiculously confusing for a while. I feel like I'm repeating but it is hard to follow this series because the lives of the Yakuza - with all their alliances, betrayals and people - is hard to follow. The movies move at a breakneck speed, are incredibly violent, but extremely fascinating. The quality doesn't really shift, and nothing (in terms of film making) changes from movie to movie, but Proxy War is great.</quote>

It's 1964, and with the Tokyo Olympics turning the eyes of the world to Japan, lawmen have set out to keep the Yakuza -- Japan's organized crime system -- out of sight. (All Movie Guide)</summary>
  <quote>I've given every film a 90 except for the first, which got an 85, and there's good reason for that. Firstly, the quality is exceptional but secondly, these films don't change from one another very much. They start the same -- explaining what has happened -- and then end with something interesting that makes you want to watch the next. 4 actually has a bit more closure and emotion than the previous ones I felt, and the major conflict between police and Yakuza is thrilling.</quote>

  <quote>The first little bit was fine but not real memorable, but when they realize that they've swapped bodies it gets really good and goes in interesting (and deep) directions. I didn't really know what to expect from the premise, but it ended up being a gorgeous movie with a lot of unbearable sadness. The ending wraps up a little clean, but at the same time I wanted the characters to have a happy ending, so I was okay with it. Also, the reoccurring boob- grabbing gag is great.</quote>

This doesn't have the traditional style of Japanese anime, which is nice, but it tells its tale mostly with visuals as there isn't much dialogue. It's easy to follow, and it's wonderfully insane. I'll probably like this more than a lot of people but there it is.</quote>

Seriously, just watching people walk in trenches was exhilarating. Performances weren't especially great but the star here is the story being told, not the actors.</quote>

The soundtrack is vital to the atmosphere. It's nice to get an intelligent sci-fi flick that doesn't offer easy answers.</quote>

  <quote>Rating wise it's below Gone Baby Gone and above The Town, all 3 of which prove that Affleck is a legit director. It's nice to see him take on a big issue, and he handles it with subtlety and finesse. Everything gels, from the tight script which is smart (yet comedic at times), to the actors (including himself). It moves along at a good pace. It doesn't hit me emotionally like GBG, but I was still involved.</quote>

  <quote>The Babadook is a scary creature and I actually enjoy its origins in a childrens book. It's a pretty decent drama with some genuinely creepy scenes but very few jump scares; jump scares aren't bad here and there once a creepy atmosphere has been built. In fact, they can be a good climax to a great scene. But it still builds that chilly atmosphere (which is infinitely more rewarding than repetitive jump scares by themselves) and despite some hokey moments, this is great stuff.</quote>

This reasonably harmonious understanding is lost when one man pulls up a heavy trunk. In the ensuing struggle, balance is lost in more than one sense. (imdb)</summary>

She lives in Joinville with wealthy benefactors and has mentioned to Franz that Mr. Stolz keeps a pile of 10,000 franc notes unlocked in his room. Franz tells his friend Arthur, a swarthy guy whose shady uncle is pressing him for money. Arthur and Franz, who mimic American movie tough guys, case Odile's house, pressure her to assist them with a burglary, and make passes at her as well. She's alternately compliant and distressed. Will they pull off the heist? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's an endearing and adventurous movie; the classic dance scene and moment of silence scene prove that. It's funny while working well as a crime drama, with fun dialogue and compelling characters. Ultimately, it's not as experimental as some other Godard films, but the accessibility does not mean it's sub-par. This is brilliant film making.</quote>

  <quote>More streamlined than the graphic novel, obviously, but it nails the neat ideas of it. The news segments, the debate on Batman, Batman being haunted by his past, good animation, everything works. Though some of the voice acting needs improvement, that doesn't really take away from the experience that much. I really like a lot of these Batman animated movies, I think it's kind of cool to see these alongside the more 'realistic' Nolan ones, though the Nolan movies are better.</quote>

The story is well told and interesting, the animation is good.</quote>

The transition was incredible, the metaphors thick, and the music incredible. Such a great last scene too, with an ending kind of like The Wrestler. Maybe next he'll tackle baseball.

Sure, there is still plenty of blood and squirting, even some pools of it, but he does show a little restraint with how he cuts away. Doesn't bother me at all because it was satisfying. Some little twists and turns kept it interesting from a plot perspective, adding some depth, and the fight choreography was on point.</quote>

  <quote>Rapping while pointing a gun at a cop was really cheesy. It's a shame because that one scene hurts, but everything around it is solid. Aside from that there wasn't anything I didn't like. I loved watching the friendship between Collin and Miles, and while the writing is obviously important, the two actors really brought that relationship to life. Blindspotting hits commentary that you might expect if you follow the news but it does so with finesse.</quote>

  <quote>At first I enjoyed the rap battles but thought some of it was a little too on the nose, like they had to explain rap to uh, white people? But then it didn't take long for the point of the PC culture satire to kick in. Sometimes I agreed, sometimes they didn't go deep enough, but for the most part it's a pretty level headed look at it. Derives its humour from shit people would find offensive but quite funny. Conflicted about the ending; emotional high but afterwards a cliché final scene.</quote>

In the vein of the first Saw (though different), where a really simple concept can be executed to perfection. I enjoyed the political content... yeah, it wasn't subtle but I don't feel like enough people think about it anyway.</quote>

  <summary>An invading army destroys all color in a harmless town and brings it in a state of depression. Then a jester arrives. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Playful, somewhat brutal (when you consider what the army is doing), fun, meaningful, artistic and intelligent. Chromophobia tackles the idea of individuality--both seemingly in society and in the military--with a lot of finesse. It's a lot simpler to follow than some of his other works that I've seen, but it's also his strongest because it's able to take this to a logical and exciting extreme. The 10 minutes zoom by.</quote>

  <quote>Sucker for superhero films AND films shot with this style. Sure, the handheld camera thing always makes you go &quot;why is there a camera here?&quot; but outside of that sometimes wonkiness (that all movies in this genre suffer from on occasion), this is so engaging. It's got drama, cool action, wonderful acting, and a nice little mysterious origin story. It's deeper than you'd think, the characters aren't cardboard cutouts, and I was into it from the very beginning.</quote>

  <quote>What an odd film. It almost reaches greatness as well. Plus it has Kong the Ghost Rider, who could be my favourite movie character ever (I don't know if I'm kidding or not). Pretty basic story: guy wants girl, girl doesn't want him. But it's how it plays out, with its heart and surrealism, that makes it effective.</quote>

  <summary>A documentary that follows the efforts of &quot;Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently,&quot; a handful of anonymous activists who banded together after their homeland was taken over by ISIS in 2014. With deeply personal access, this is the story of a brave group of citizen journalists as they face the realities of life undercover, on the run, and in exile, risking their lives to stand up against one of the greatest evils in the world today. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This is one of those documentaries that cut to the bone and make it difficult to rate. This is shit that is still going on, this is horrific. It could have maybe gone into more detail about everything, but then the purpose was to show RBSS, what they are doing, what is going on in Syria, what ISIS is doing... so the history of what brought this menace into existence is not what matters. It gets the point across. There are better edited/filmed docs, but rarely are they this important.</quote>

  <quote>It's um... interesting. It's definitely completely out there and that makes it fascinating. The set designs are astounding and there are some fantastic ideas in there but like some others have said... it's quite goofy. It's nice to see a movie with such good ideas not taking itself completely seriously and I like ridiculous things, but sometimes it goes too far and you can't get the connection you need. But you need to see it because it's totally original and beautiful.</quote>

  <quote>The film is lit with a lot of red and shot wonderfully. Bergman's just really good at making sad movies and this one will do a number on you if you really immerse yourself. I don't like it as much as say, Persona, but I don't like very many movies as much as that. It's about two sisters and their maid (slave?) looking after their other sister, who's on her death bed, simultaneously fearing her death and wishing for it. The ending is really touching.</quote>

Besides that, you have a fantastically made movie with incredible cinematography that really enhances the general emotions of the film. Pitt is almost always incredible and of course Fincher is a great director and he shows it here. The CGI isn't just there to show off, as it blends in seemlessly. It's not a perfect film though, it does have a few scenes that feel odd, but who cares? It's sad as fuck.</quote>

  <quote>As Filligan said, it does certainly feel like a modern Strangelove... though not as good. It's still a wildly entertaining time though. Great casting, everybody was perfectly suited for their roles. I love that the actors speak naturally because movies focus too much on them usually and this lets the comedy flow; and it was quite a funny flick for maybe half of it. It loses some steam as it goes on; the kinetic energy is still there but it's not as comedic. But its never boring.</quote>

  <quote>Just really interesting stuff, partially because of the subject matter (who doesn't like this true crime shit?) and partially because Herzog is interesting AND knows what questions to ask. While he starts every episode telling you what he thinks, he mostly lets the people interviewed present their cases. Occasionally he makes a remark but it's so fun to hear him talk that it's okay. There is emotional depth here, and the element of &quot;who's telling the truth?&quot; is appealing.</quote>

  <quote>It took me a little while to see the film on its own terms. I think it can be mildly tedious at times but that isn't enough to seriously hurt this stylish slasher. The gore is effective, and it's most entertaining when death is happening. There are a few legitimately scary scenes but for the most part Argento approaches murder with glee here. Seriously, the ending is a perfect example of that. The music is odd but fits once you get past the hurdle of this being unconventional for the genre.</quote>

  <quote>This is only my second Jeunet film, so I'm assuming this type of visual style is the norm for him. Which isn't bad, not at all. It's one of those styles where you will always be able to tell it's a Jeunet film. I like musical saws, and there was a lot of weirdness and surrealism. The visual style adds this 'other worldly' feel to it, which makes sense considering what the movie's about. Post-apocalyptic? Goood. Surrealist black comedy? Goood. Cannibalism? Gooood.

  <summary>A coming of age comedy/drama for the post hip hop generation. Malcolm is a geek, carefully surviving life in The Bottoms, a tough neighborhood in Inglewood, CA filled gangsters and drugs dealers, while juggling his senior year of college applications, interviews and the SAT. His dream is to attend Harvard. A chance invitation to a big underground party leads Malcolm and his friends into a, only in Los Angeles, gritty adventure filed with offbeat characters and bad choices. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Admittedly it stops being funny a little ways through (though up until that point I laughed quite a bit), and only occasionally sprinkles laughs into the mix as it transforms into a drama. I just love rap as a soundtrack for movies, and even a scene with a Korn song was awesome. In fact, it's a perfect marriage of music and visuals throughout. Tonally all over the place, but it's a lot of fun to watch because it's so energetic; a compelling and dynamic experience w/o becoming a mess.</quote>

  <summary>Once two overzealous cops get suspended from the force, they must delve into the criminal underworld to get their just due. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's incredibly slow but sometimes these really slow movies come out where there's something endearing/magical about the way that it so unapologetically lends itself to the pacing, like The American years ago. This fits into that. I never knew what was going to happen, the third act (as noted by someone else) is tense, and also just very deliberate feeling, refreshing. Vaughn and Gibson are great together. The dialogue's style doesn't work all the time, occasionally feeling overwritten.</quote>

  <quote>Take my critic card away if you want, but I really enjoyed it. I just found it funny and clever, ultimately, and it subverted conventions in meaningful and entertaining ways. The chemistry between Whitman and Amell was really good and helped it a lot, and while it does go to a place you'd expect... it was a fun journey. I'm very surprised by this because I expected to hate it, as the trailers were terrible.</quote>

  <summary>In a futuristic world, a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Cleric John Preston (Bale) is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. When he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.</summary>
  <quote>It doesn't know what dystopian book it wants to be but that's okay because it borrows from classics. Mix in Bale and some nice martial-arts gunplay, and you got yourself a great movie.</quote>

  <quote>Ima bump this to an 85 because the ending was incredible, but really the last half hour or so was pretty awesome stuff. It doesn't hit a 90 though because the rest of it was quite good as a whole but a little tedious. You could see that as commentary, and maybe it is, but it was still not as entertaining to watch as I would have hoped, and I feel that the premise--which is excellent--deserves a little better. It's still ultimately a great film but I have a tinge of disappointment.</quote>

  <quote>Incredibly emotional piece. Some of it is a bit too much, too unsubtle and in your face (in a bad way), but that's a pretty minimal problem when you consider by the end I was so invested in what was going on that I had forgotten the bad. Great song playing during the credits, wonderful performance by Jordan, and the beginning (with the real footage) was a great way to start. Gritty, cruel, cold, unflinching, sentimental, all of these things describe this movie.</quote>

Dialogue is excellent. As natebarrios perfectly said, &quot;a hybrid of Clerks and La Haine.&quot;</quote>

What a depressing and violent ending. It takes what may have been an 80 or 85 and turns it into a hard 90. One of the more memorable endings I think I've seen.</quote>

  <summary>A paraplegic man leaves home for the first time only to discover that life on the outside is not like he had imagined it. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This was a very good short. Excellent shot composition, an odd soundtrack to go along with a movie that's odd in tone. The music builds tension and makes it feel weird, kind of like a Korine movie (but not quite there). It's a dark comedy, but it's probably more dark than funny, and I found myself being concerned with what was going to happen to this guy. The ending was... well, unexpected and again, dark. Memorable though.</quote>

  <summary>In his mesmerizing new film, acclaimed director Werner Herzog explores the life and death of amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist Timothy Treadwell.  (Lions Gate Films)</summary>
  <quote>Timothy is interesting enough by himself but what makes this even better -- besides the great footage, and the interesting subject matter -- is Herzog's commentary. He's poetic but never pretentious and always fascinating. I like how he, not surprisingly, concentrates a lot on the film making process.</quote>

  <quote>I wouldn't say it's the scariest movie by any means, but it's certainly creepy some of the time. However, it is well made and interesting, even if we've seen this a million times now. Back then though it would have been fresher. I do love how Myers isn't humanized, and he just struts around like a force of evil, rather than a human. And of course, the theme song, which always adds something to the scenes that it's played, even when it's just the intro credits.</quote>

  <quote>Some real corniness here but I've already spent too much time talking about that and not enough about what is important here: the violence. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, potent and exciting, with lots of blood, slow motion and bullets. A stylish action movie and that's all it aspires to be. Would be a 90 for me but it would have been nice to have a little bit more backing up the wonderful action.</quote>

  <quote>A great parody/homage to melodramatic soap operas AND slasher flicks. It's about actors playing actors on a television show so while the dialogue is intentionally hammy, it's also delivered with a lot of conviction. The cinematography brilliantly mimics the way soap operas look as well. It's just a really great time if you're looking for something silly and funny.</quote>

  <quote>Gory, with ridiculous kills, and even some crazy badasses (The Plague). It's kind of sad that I felt something during this movie because it's so silly. I think it's just because I naturally feel for homeless people. So it's nice to see the cheesy one liners, the intentional overacting, and the redemption. I also like the speech that Abby gives, that has the line (not exact): &quot;They have the biggest home, the streets. We're in it, so you can show some god damn respect.&quot;</quote>

  <quote>Movies like this are needed sometimes; nothing is really explained but there are hints scattered throughout. Sometimes that is incredibly refreshing, but the film has to be made well... and this is. From the opening music/quote the film felt oppressive. It's really dark, but tonally consistent. There's no relief here, you're just trapped in this slightly surreal, messed up world where snow (something so beautiful) just helps cage the characters and the viewer. Let the themes sink in to enjoy it.</quote>

  <quote>I'm apparently a massive HG apologist despite never reading the books. I just dig these movies. I think this was awesome. Was it slow? Kinda, but it was a good slow. It was building and building, watching the little acts of rebellion was intense. This was darker and more gritty, with less comic relief and a general sense of urgency. Sure, it doesn't have a ton of action but it doesn't need it because the action that does take place has huge consequences. Part 1 tried something a little diff.</quote>

Re: the commentary--I think it does set the libs up to be the bad guys a little more than the conservs but a lot of the outrage in society is on the extremes... so to blast the extreme left is fine. The left isn't immune. But it does try to criticize both sides and for the most part it does it well. It's a movie with limited time, it can't go super in-depth in that time frame without becoming a documentary.</quote>

Great costumes, visuals, etc. The script is by the books: not especially good, not bad, but the actors do a good job, and the fight scenes were great. I mean maybe it's because I think the visuals are more inspired than other movies of this type, and it doesn't masturbate over slow-mo as much as something like 300 does, and the violence is cool and brutal. It allows me to ignore flaws more than some others apparently.</quote>

It helps that his character is written so well; a writer who lacks inspiration until a lady comes in, he's violent, clever, creepy, charming and capable of some really beautiful things. Outside of that, the film just does a wonderful job showing the human side of things while giving a compelling mystery about a murder, and whether Bogart did it or not. Plays with you, intelligent script, great sense of style.</quote>

  <summary>A mother's last wishes send twins Jeanne and Simon on a journey to Middle East in search of their tangled roots. Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's acclaimed play, Incendies tells the powerful and moving tale of two young adults' voyage to the core of deep-rooted hatred, never-ending wars and enduring love. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Harrowing, that bus scene is something else. Villeneuve wasn't afraid to show how terrible things could be but he didn't play it for shocks and he didn't rely on gore. The final plot twist is maybe a little too much in order to get to where it wanted to go, and he could have ended it sooner, but I'm forgiving of it because where it went was (another) gut punch. Expertly shot, draws out a little too much at times, but really an excellent movie once it truly gets going.</quote>

  <quote>Solidly put together, even if it doesn't bring anything truly new to the ever present superhero genre. However, it's really funny, has some heart, balances its social commentary well; having a female main character in this day and age is always going to bring gender politics with it. Fun, inventive action, and I thought Screenslaver's introduction was quite good and menacing, and it's ultimately a decent (not great, not horrible) villain. A worthy sequel.</quote>

  <quote>Inevitably have to compare it to The Departed. This has better pacing, an interesting style and since it was quicker, it was more of a thrill ride. But it was also cheesy on occasion so some of the more emotional elements didn't work. The Departed had a great cast and some humour, felt more bloated. I think Infernal Affairs might be a better film; I'll rate it higher but they're pretty close in quality anyway. I love the ending here though.</quote>

  <quote>A shaggy dog detective tale with a plot that is confusing but not really important. You could try to follow it but it'll be difficult and you'll be frustrated because it sets things up to not give you what you want. Great performances all around, a great style and atmosphere. The comedy works; it ranges from slapstick to more clever gags, and while the work isn't as &quot;important&quot; as some other PTA films... neither was the book. It was pulp literature. Movie should have been shorter though.</quote>

Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Either 85 or 90, will re-evaluate. Not the best Pixar but that's simply because I felt that there were periods that slacked a little. But then it was so easy to forget those because of the extremely memorable and amazing scenes that were scattered throughout. None of it was ever bad, and there was some emotional depth along with a clever representation of emotions. That fucking gum jingle though (awesome reoccurring gag). Thoroughly enjoyed it though, great flick.</quote>

  <quote>I wish I would have seen this when it was first made, because there's a Blair Witch element to it where people didn't know if it was real or not. That makes it a little more eerie, but even so, there's an impending doom here, and when the conclusion hits it's pretty devastating. Love the experimental nature of it, how it uses the internet to tell this story. Even detached from the (relative) hysteria, it's a fascinating short.</quote>

  <quote>Just a fascinating look at what coulda been. Jodorowsky gushes about his version of Dune (probably a little too much, saying how it'll be the most important film ever), but it's still nice to see the passion he has for his projects, and to see what went on behind the scenes. Though there is no actual footage, they paint a vivid picture of what was in his mind. It's always interesting. It's one-sided, but this isn't a documentary that has to have multiple sides. It's about the ppl making it.</quote>

  <summary>Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, an offbeat young woman makes an unusual and bizarre decision regarding her unborn child. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A while ago I would have given this a 70, but it's grown on me. I don't think the dialogue is as unrealistic as others -- just exaggerated -- and I think it captures the teens who go on the internet really well. I've seen them try to one up each other with things like bands constantly. This is a more realistic film than people say, and it's touching and sometimes funny. It's charming and Ellen Page is convincing in the role, not to mention pretty (it helps).</quote>

  <summary>Things go badly for a hack director and film crew shooting a low budget zombie movie in an abandoned WWII Japanese facility, when they are attacked by real zombies. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A lot of fun and creative, especially given the budget. Like others have said, it's best not read about before a watch. The way that it filmed the wonderful opener and then dissects it in the second half is great. I wouldn't say it was laugh out loud funny by any means but I chuckled a few times and loved seeing the chaos that ensued to film it.</quote>

  <quote>&quot;A cat meowing at your feet, looking up at you, is life smiling at you. Those are moments when we're lucky, they remind us that we're alive.&quot; What a beautiful ending, but also representative of the movie as a whole. You see cute cats and people telling stories about what they do and what their personality is. Does a good job of touching on cultural importance of cats, but if this was longer it would get a little tedious. I threw my critical lense out for this one because it speaks to me and aww.</quote>

  <quote>Thought it was extremely well written and honest. Not everything that the characters do is pretty, but the characters seem like real people. That's refreshing because too often in a movie like this characters are written just for some drama, whereas in this it's, yes, more organic.  Even though some of the movie is conventional, it is handled so much better than most movies of this type. Moore is amazing yet again. It's not really a comedy... it does drama better.</quote>

  <summary>Nomura is an eerily handsome, sharply dressed, sociopathic serial killer who preys on the women of Tokyo. In Jakarta, a world-weary journalist named Bayu finds himself unexpectedly falling into vigilantism after brutally killing two sadistic robbers. When each posts videos of his violent sprees online, the pair find one another on the Internet and begin a toxic and competitive duel. While Bayu clings to the hope that he can resume a normal life, Nomura continues to spill blood without remorse. (Sundance)</summary>
  <quote>I found the last couple minutes kind of cheesy and stupid, but the rest of the movie was really great. It explored some really dark psychological shit in an interesting way, such as violence and what drives us to it. The relationship between the serial killer and the journalist is intriguing, the violence is incredibly brutal, and it's shot really well.</quote>

  <quote>Direction is on point here. Very Kubrick with his tracking shots and general detachment. That doesn't always work but it here it creates an endearing coldness, much like the hospital that a lot of this takes place in; or even their own house, honestly. He is a voyeur, often zooming in on people, but he also makes hallways seem really long; a long, difficult passage to where these people have to be. Can be a little slow at times, which prevents it from a 90. Vague, but interesting.</quote>

That doesn't mean it's bad or unoriginal; it's just the tone is off in the same ways (in a good way). It's not really that funny, though it does have some decent jokes, but De Niro's performance is awesome and it's an unpredictable film; some of it is awkward and uncomfortable, but yet there is some sympathy here for the characters.</quote>

Saoirse Ronan puts in work here that is worthy of the attention she has gotten, touching on all the different notes but never overdoing it.

  <quote>Yeah, it does pretty much the same thing a lot of westerns do but Belden and Morgan have a very convincing friendship and seeing the exchanges between the two characters was great. The woman was lame but then if I didn't seperate myself from that in a lot of westerns I'd probably hate the genre. I thought that the movie was pretty tense and suspenseful most of the time, and we got a great draw at the end (though that's to be expected).</quote>

  <summary>Louis C.K. Stand-up Special</summary>
  <quote>When he gets on a roll with his jokes he is laugh out loud funny, and his &quot;controversial&quot; jokes never seem forced like some comedians.
Not his best but it's damn good.</quote>

  <summary>The spiritual journey of a ninety-year-old atheist. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A quaint little film with almost no drama to speak of, just an old man (played wonderfully by Stanton) going about his rounds, basically. But there's something a little profound about his conversations and his thoughts. Even though he's so great as Lucky and his death adds another level of oomph to it, I have to admit that Howard (David Lynch) and his views on his tortoise really hit me.</quote>

  <quote>Damn, that ending is perfect and touching. Some of the musical numbers didn't hit for me and got in the way of better storytelling, but as it went on I felt they got better. But you come to a movie like this because it's so unapologetically original and weird; a musical horror romance about mermaids where there's a glee to how fantastic it all is while never shying away from the disgusting aspects. Maybe not all people will like it, but it's refreshing cinema.</quote>

  <quote>This movie feels like the industrial genre in music. It's dark, surreal and slightly off putting. The cinematography succeds because of the oozing atmopshere that it helps create. Bale gives an incredible performance and by the time everything was revealed, I was slightly drained.</quote>

  <summary>Trevor is a 16 year old, sometimes-violent skinhead with no regard for authority, and would rather spend his time stealing cars than sitting in the detention centre to which he is sent. His social worker, Harry Parker, tries to do his best, but Trevor is only interested when there&amp;amp;#039;s something that he can get out of it. The authorities within the centre try to make Trevor conform to the norms of society, but he takes no notice, and would rather speak in a torrent of four-letter words and racial abuse. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This examines the situation extremely well. You got this smart, but ultimately misguided teen and he's stuck in these facilities to try to correct him. The anti-establishment shit he spews is sometimes so spot-on, but yet he's still ultimately a completely racist dick. It shows the character as gray, and there's a great performance by Roth to bring him alive. It's a gritty, intelligent movie, that doesn't go far, but it makes logical sense.</quote>

  <quote>The animation is beautiful and expressive, with the creature being surprisingly emotive. Sure, for most of it you're just watching this thing create something, and no matter how gorgeous it is, it wouldn't be deserving of anything more than an 80 (which is still hugely respectable). However, that ending puts it all into context and adds the proper oomph; it's not even that difficult to understand. Just appreciate life, work for happiness, find those people/things you love.</quote>

  <quote>It's Ritchie being Ritchie and that's really all I want. Easily his best movie in years; a compelling and funny spy movie in a year that already has a bunch of those. I have to give special attention to the soundtrack and the casting. Cavill, Hammer and Vikander all have an &quot;old movie&quot; timeless quality to them in different ways. Sometimes shots go on too long, occasionally without a proper payoff but that's a minor gripe. Story isn't amazing but its good, faults covered by the humor and cast.</quote>

  <quote>Criticker doesn't allow me enough space to fully explain myself but, I love the dark tone, appreciate the absolute seriousness (because why does every movie have to be Marvel?), and I usually hate Supes but I cared here. Snyder, once again, showcases talent in perfectly blending insane action with an incredible soundtrack... which is his main focus generally. It's a little long, but generally moves along at a good pace. Script is fine enough to compliment the action and Cavill is convincing.</quote>

  <quote>A beautiful story about motherhood. Other things happen--there's a war for example--but the relationship between Ariel and Maquia is what matters here. It might be a little sappy for some people but their interactions were powerful, and the reflections on their relationship equally so. The animation is pretty stunning, the story can be a little confusing at times. Lots of movies are about family, this one is especially potent.</quote>

  <quote>It's actually a really good character study in a subtle way. For example, like one person on here said; she runs away yet defends it. This is interesting and well done because sometimes victims of abuse are like that. It becomes ingrained in them. I just thought the way they handled her was really well done... not heavy handed yet accurate. It was never boring, sometimes terrifying. Honestly I'm not sure on the ending... gotta think about it more.</quote>

  <quote>A slice of life film is built upon buying into the relationships between the characters since generally not a whole lot happens. This is a good example of subgenre. The chemistry between the friends is really cool, it feels natural. Sometimes it's nice to have things explored more deeply but I actually think that the unspoken words spoke volumes and it didn't really need it. The relatively short runtime means it doesn't overstay itself; we get just enough. Very emotional with a bomb soundtrack.</quote>

Along with the beautiful imagery of Finland and the music, these stories go deep into one simple fact of life: No matter where we're from, what we do, what we wear, we're all more alike than we think.</quote>

  <summary>The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin, causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go rogue to clear their organization's name. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Not as good as the first, which is still a clever and interesting thrill ride, but this is also the best since the 1st and I can say I actually really like this. Yeah the melodrama was poorly played but the action (like the entire Dubai sequence) was pretty awesome and jaw-dropping. And the more gadget/espionage oriented parts were also entertaining. A nice return to form for the series. Also: I love Tom Cruise the actor.</quote>

  <quote>Taylor is not a great director but this... Mom and Dad is easily his best film. Blair manages to go back and forth between loving mom and insane with ease, and this is the most inspired I've seen Cage in a very long time. The great casting paid off because they cared. I love the premise. There's actually a little bit of heart within this (after the sledgehammer part), but mostly you're here to watch a black comedy, crazy movie about parents killing kids... and it succeeds admirably.</quote>

  <quote>Does a lot with so little. It's not bombastic and there are so few sets that some people might not be into it, but for those who want a more emotional character driven sci-fi flick then you can't go wrong here. The story explores its themes effectively even if it's a little predictable once the twist happens pretty early; however, that didn't seem to matter because the writing was sound and so was Rockwell. Also, the OST is fantastic.</quote>

  <quote>Maddin gives us a creative documentary where Rossellini works through her feelings for her father and his movies. It could have just been a documentary where she sits there merely talking, but this is more because of the directorial prowess of Maddin and the writing of Rossellini. Watching her act as different important figures in the industry in order to debate her fathers' work was pretty riveting stuff, and definitely a fresh take on this kind of documentary.</quote>

  <quote>For sure it's very very interesting and original. The narration becomes a bit much and sometimes seems forced, like it has to be more poetic than it should be, but then other times he's right on, mixing fact and fiction to create a work that explores memory, nostalgia and ultimately, the difficulty to truly leave your town/city (who you are) and the oppressive nature of this. Really liked the images and the cinematography as well. Also enjoyed his stuff about hockey rinks when he gets angry.</quote>

  <quote>Obvious comparison is with The Raid. This lacks a little in the choreography (it's still awesome but sometimes people just stand around waiting a little too much) but trades it for more bloodshed. It's incredibly violent, everything feels crunchy with bad intentions. It's a thrill ride but The Raid series has slightly better fights and a better story. When the fighting isn't happening the pacing feels a little off, but I love what Indonesia is bringing out in this genre.</quote>

  <quote>Such a beautiful film, every second is a gorgeous painting. Even the stuff that the old man goes through is impactful, watching him struggle near the end was heartbreaking. However, what keeps this from being a 9 is just how silly the boy's voice acting is. The old man's is fine, though not stellar, yet the boy was dreadful and did what he could to ruin a scene. Luckily, he could not, but it's a shame that the performances weren't better.</quote>

  <quote>Definitely really enjoyed it, loved seeing Brando (who rightfully gets a lot of praise), Saint and Cobb especially. There are some great moments like in the back of the cab, and the direction is good. However, I don't know; I guess it just doesn't have the extra oomph to put it up to a 90 for me. Maybe it's because there are some odd moments, like when loud sounds/music plays over important scenes where it is not needed, and detracts from it. Still a classic and deserving of the status.</quote>

  <summary>In the dead of night, a group of men - including a police commissioner, a prosecutor, a doctor and a murder suspect - drive through the tenebrous Anatolian countryside, the serpentine roads and rolling hills lit only by the headlights of their cars. They are searching for a corpse, the victim of a brutal murder. The suspect, who claims he was drunk, can't remember where he buried the body. As the night draws on, details about the murder emerge and the investigators' own secrets and hypocrisies come to light. In the Anatolian steppes, nothing is what it seems; and when the body is found, the real questions begin. (cinemaguild.com)</summary>
  <quote>Definitely an absolutely stunning movie visually. The night scenes are beautiful and so well lit, the day time shots are equally as wonderful. I like the ending, and the performances by everyone are all great. Also; the script is solid. But then at the same time, I have to side with people who say it could be half an hour or so shorter. I suppose maybe it's the point but it gets a little too mundane at times. Still great, though, could have been a 95.</quote>

  <summary>Seymour 'SY' Parrish has been doing photo development for 20 years. He has a vast knowledge of modern photography and develops photos at a local department store for a living. But SY lives a sad and lonely life and begins spying on the Yorkin family, his biggest customers who seem to have everything in the world. SY begins to feel that he wants to be in the Yorkin's life, but when he discovers that the Yorkins are not as perfect as they seem, he becomes a man on a mission to expose the imperfections of the Yorkin family that could tear them apart. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Robin Williams gives a great performance as creepy (I'm talking as creepy as me looking in your window right now) Seymour Parrish in this little movie that doesn't try to be more than it is. While he is creepy, I admire his dedication to what he does, and more importantly, his passion. I also feel bad for his loneliness.</quote>

  <quote>I'm not getting the hate. Movies CAN be &quot;style over substance&quot; and that's okay. A nice stylish film is good once in a while, and this excels at that. The lighting, the little dialogue, the way it drifts from scene to scene... it all works. I think this is more symbolic than literal, so yes the plot isn't amazing in that sense but I feel there's more to it. It was just fun to watch because it did things its own way. Plus I love the fight scene between Gosling and the cop, love the music and mood.</quote>

  <quote>Liked this quite a bit more than a lot of others I'm gathering, but to me it was a nice, slow-paced emotional crime drama, with excellent cinematography, acting and music. Sure, it's not like it's original, but it's done quite well, and the ultimate revenge felt satisfying, due largely in part to Bale being such a good actor. I was interested the entire time and it never felt cheesy.</quote>

  <quote>Ebert says review based on what a movie is trying to accomplish. I agree. The story is okay, and the characters are compelling enough that you care. It promised over the top robots vs monsters. And it does this. Is the story cliche? Yes. But some people are waaaay too harsh on that. So many movies are cliche and have a focus on story... this isn't focused on that so the story is good enough. Over the top characters in an over the top movie is acceptable. Also the visual design is awesome.</quote>

While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington spots a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruber's antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it. But when the book is stolen, it's up to Paddington and the Browns to unmask the thief. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's just as whimsical as the original but I think I like it a little bit more as a whole. While the first lost a little steam near the end, this didn't. I felt it more emotional, just as funny and of course the message is moving. While great for kids and adults alike, these deserve credit for being visually interesting; the paper London part especially was cool, but it's full of little fantastical touches that elevate it beyond most other kid flicks. And I didn't grow up with Paddington.</quote>

  <quote>Admittedly I'm a sucker for this type of movie so they have to work less hard to get me, but I think this works harder. Excellent choreography, some great shots here and there, and I love the musical choices; perfect choices to heighten the different moods. Unlike some other movies in the genre, this does not cop out and give a happy ending. It's dark, relentless, and when Koo kills it's earned, emotional.  You feel the satisfaction of revenge but at the same time it strives for more.</quote>

  <quote>While the story is nothing that different really, what makes ParaNorman so good is how well it's told: with heart and intelligence. I laughed numerous times, and I won't lie... the movie touched me a couple times, especially in the last section, which is so brilliantly done it leaves &quot;kids&quot; movies with a lot to live up to. Hell, the whole movie does. It straddles the line between kid and adult really well. Ultimately a kids horror-comedy, it's adult enough for older people as well.</quote>

Spanning a period of 22 years these films revolve skittishly around human nature, and apart from the more documentary Life in Denmark, each has actor Claus Nissen as Leth's artful alter ego...

  <quote>It's simple. The perfect man and woman are in a boundless white &quot;room,&quot; which is really just a white screen. They are treated like they are in a zoo, with the narrating explaining what a human is. &quot;This is an eye.&quot; What this movie does really well is make you question the entire idea of a perfect human and whether our whole model for it is downright ridiculous. Great film and I can see why Lars Von Trier loves it.</quote>

  <summary>When Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?</summary>
  <quote>I didn't even overly want to see this, and at 2 and a half hours, it could have easily become tiresome... but it didn't at all. The suspense built until the very end, which resulted in a wonderful climax. Everything is on point, the acting, the beautiful cinematography, every inch of the movie is carefully thought out. It takes a familiar type of movie and does a really good job with it.</quote>

  <summary>Aussie director John Hillcoat helmed this gripping, epic-scale Western set in the thick of the 1880s outback. When no-nonsense lawman Capt. Stanley (Ray Winstone) apprehends the notorious Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and his younger sibling, Mikey (Richard Wilson), Stanley makes Charlie an unsavory proposition: If he murders his outlaw brother, Arthur (Danny Huston), Mikey will escape the hangman's noose. Emily Watson plays Stanley's genteel wife. </summary>

  <summary>Chris Gardner (Smith) is a bright and talented, but marginally employed salesman. Struggling to make ends meet, Gardner finds himself and his five-year-old son evicted from their San Francisco apartment with nowhere to go. When Gardner lands an internship at a prestigious stock brokerage firm, he and his son endure many hardships, including living in shelters, in pursuit of his dream of a better life for the two of them.  (Sony)</summary>
  <quote>I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would. Smith proves that he is in fact a talented actor. His character wrestles with his own demons while trying to keep his relationship with his son existent, providing protection and a possible hope for the future. It demands a lot of the viewer emotionally and if you're willing to give yourself to it, it's easily a 85.</quote>

  <summary>A young man named Rune is given a two-year sentence in prison, where he is exploited and abused by his fellow inmates, who engage in drug trade and violent conflicts within the prison.</summary>
  <quote>I hear that this is a lot like Un Prophete so maybe if I have seen it (it's in my queue), then I'd like this less? I don't know, but as it stands: this is a bleak, gritty story. It's not a real original story but due to the acting of Rune and Rashid (loved Rashid especially), the cinematography, the set design, the intense score, the ending (loved the still shot of the prison to end it), it rises above. Also, like another said, the documentary style approach is great.</quote>

But even if you know this stuff, Jaye's own journey from her feminist roots is just as interesting, showcasing her own inner struggles concerning what she is learning.</quote>

  <quote>Dawn is a slightly superior movie as a whole (I rate them the same technically but Dawn is closer to a 95), but this really set a high standard. Being an origin story, it has to set everything up... but it does so admirably. Franco is kind of meh, but Serkis was amazing, like in the sequel, and it tells a simplistic but effective story. More impressively, it does so with minimal speech when compared to other films.</quote>

That's all I expect, I didn't expect it to get all the critical details of the writing because it's not possible. So it's bleak, and never boring. Suicide party!</quote>

  <quote>It doesn't have the scale or excitement of a new Episode, for obvious reasons, but as it approached I kept saying I think it'll be a better MOVIE than The Force Awakens. Tyler was right! It's gritty but with enough comedy (mostly from K-2SO) to make it genuinely funny. I actually cared about these characters quite a bit. The ending scene was fantastic. My only issue is that Whitaker sometimes hams it up and he did here; luckily he wasn't around a lot. Smaller story but intimate and exciting.</quote>

  <summary>After his 16-year-old daughter goes missing, a desperate father breaks into her laptop to look for clues to find her. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Within 15 minute I was emotionally attached to this family because the gimmick works. Little things like deleting an important saved video says so much by just being a simple gesture, and Chaganty knew that. Cho was really great, the story was told exceptionally well with a few fun twists and turns. But it's all about that emotional depth and this has it in spades. The final twist probably wasn't required but at the same time it just gave me more of a movie I was really enjoying so that was ok.</quote>

The humour works, the story has just the right amount of suspense but it's also incredibly playful. It has some plot points that it doesn't wrap up (though I wonder if that is intentional considering how self-aware it is), but it's easy to ignore any minor flaws that exist considering it's so entertaining.</quote>

While true that the plot is a little derivative, it was done in an interesting and emotionally charged way. I don't see how people see this as &quot;empty&quot; when he is constantly struggling between being a gangster and wanting to be normal again. Also, that last shot of him by himself in a cage is great; true solitude.</quote>

  <quote>Snowpiercer is pretty heavy-handed in its approach but I'm not criticizing it for that. This is very much a poor vs rich movie, with religious undertones (the engine is sacred). But it is beautifully shot and really does a good job of representing all classes both physically and with good writing. I'm very much down with a class warfare movie, always, and everyone fires on all cylinders for this one. Even Evans, who I don't think is amazing as a whole, does well here.</quote>

It's a musical cop movie, with some surrealism (the times of silence and whatnot), and it does it all so well.</quote>

It's fun, the fighting is good but brings nothing fresh, there's a little tension, Keaton is cool but underdeveloped, Holland is great (best Spider-Man to date), and I still just like superhero movies a lot.

  <quote>Worth watching just for the animation alone. There's so much going on here that it really is a feast for the eyes. While the plot doesn't go as far as it could have, the brilliance of how the movie presents itself allows for a lot of kinetic energy. It's incredibly hard to be bored by this, but I'm not willing to say it's &quot;amazing&quot; because there are flaws that admittedly it tries its best to hide. There's also some legit intimacy here which I didn't really expect.</quote>

  <summary>Elsa and Clive, two young rebellious scientists, defy legal and ethical boundaries and forge ahead with an experiment: splicing together human and animal DNA to create a new organism.</summary>
  <quote>I think if you go in expecting horror you'll be disappointed. It's a suspenseful sci-fi flick. This is definitely daring and I was interested the entire time. I thought it dragged for a few minutes total but that's nothing. The camera work was fantastic, the story intriguing. Gory but not too gory (so it's effective). And the things I thought were stupid at I watched it, I could quickly rationalize and so the movie is very cohesive (even the strange parts). The creature was great as well.</quote>

  <summary>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... Princess Leia (Fisher) is held hostage by the evil Imperial forces in their effort to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker (Hamill) and Captain Han Solo (Ford) team together with the lovable droid duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. (20th Century Fox)</summary>
  <quote>Great start to a classic series. Though I find Hamill to be the weakest link, everyone else does a great job, especially Ford who is charming as hell. Amazing model work, great usage of special effects, a fun story, wonderful music, visuals that still look good today. Because of the talent involved, the sometimes corny dialogue is still cool. Not much more you can say, there's a reason it's so highly regarded.</quote>

  <summary>Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS Agent whose world is turned upside-down when he begins to hear his life being chronicled by a narrator only he can hear. The Narrator, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a nearly forgotten author of tragic novels, is struggling to complete her latest and best book, unaware that her protagonist is alive and uncontrollably guided by her words. Fiction and reality collide when the bewildered and hilariously resistant Harold hears the Narrator say that events have been set in motion that will lead to his imminent death.  (Sony)</summary>
  <quote>A mostly serious role for Will, but surprisingly one of his best. This movie, along with The Weather Man, ended up being more drama than comedy.</quote>

  <summary>Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson star in a two-character drama that examines the relationship between strangers who are brought together by desperate circumstances. (HBO)</summary>
  <quote>Fantastic acting and a fantastic script. It's a simple concept of two people in a room, talking, and really it couldn't be done any better. Jones and Jackson give some of their best performances, ever. I can't stress that enough: watching them was a treat. It's smart but emotional, even funny a few times. A movie about -- among other things -- belief, though I'd have to rewatch it to catch every single thought and view expressed, but really, they're both right in some ways.</quote>

  <quote>If you just go in and accept what it is, you will be treated to a short that's very much like Tarkovsky's Mirror in the way it tells its &quot;story.&quot; I think the title actually makes a lot of sense. But anyway, yeah, it's pretty difficult to understand because it's fractured memories, but the way its set up, the beautiful imagery, and even the memorable characters (I love the bull and the wolf), makes this an amazing short. Truly deserving of the hype.</quote>

  <summary>Introducing some innovative film techniques, Emshwiller won a Special Award at the Brussels Experimental Film Festival for this expression of internal anguish. He described the film as &quot;The confrontation of a man and his torment. Juxtaposed against his external composure are images of a woman and lights in distortion, with tension heightened by the sounds of power saws and a heartbeat.&quot; (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The audio here really puts this up on a high level. The images are okay, they're interesting at first. But it's the sound effects that really keep you intrigued while watching the distorted images on the screen. Without such powerful, yet simplistic, sounds, this would be like a 70 or something and just a mere curiousity instead of what it is now: a fantastic short.</quote>

What is best about this is Trier's denial of a simple, happy ending; you're left with a big question, something to ponder. I hate when movies shoehorn lightness in, and this doesn't do that. Trier knew how to instill a certain mood and stuck to it, hit enough emotional depth to make me feel like I was watching more than just an interesting movie (which would be fine).</quote>

Villain is okay, doesn't really break the MCU standard of having decent but not great villains. Even though the Hulk jokes worked, I don't really like seeing Hulk THAT jokey.

I actually enjoy the slow build and the POV shots because it makes it personal. What keeps this from being a 90 or more, and top of its class, is simply the extended slo-mo scenes, that don't have the intended effect of making me feel the violence/bloodshed. One or two would have been great, but it meant the payoff wasn't what it COULD be. Still great though.</quote>

  <summary>A seemingly benign TV interviewer asks people in the street (and under the street), &quot;What&amp;amp;#039;s your opinion about the actual political situation?&quot; Several people fumble, one won&amp;amp;#039;t talk, and an older man who sits in an easy chair says, &quot;Make love.&quot;  (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I don't think you could tackle this subject matter any better than this. At first it seems kind of silly and good but not great but then it just starts hitting you over the head with aggressive weirdness. Everything is symbolic and stuff becomes a mantra for us to hear over and over (consumerism for example), and it really hits how we don't say what we think in fear of what will happen. This is an amazing short.</quote>

  <quote>There are certainly moments where the plot goes off the rails and things just happen that make you scratch your head, wondering why they thought it would be cool to include that. But it's also stylish, jazz-influenced and Yakuza... so it has that going for it. When it sticks to its strengths, it's really awesome, but the leaps in logic/sense keeps it from being a truly amazing movie. Still, most of the movie is gorgeous but some scenes are awe-inspiring.</quote>

Amy lives by that credo -- enjoying what she feels is an uninhibited life free from stifling, boring romantic commitment -- but in actuality, she's kind of in a rut. When she finds herself starting to fall for the subject of the new article she's writing, a charming and successful sports doctor, Amy starts to wonder if other grown-ups, including this guy who really seems to like her, might be on to something. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Amy Schumer can win me over with more things like this. While it's a little too long, and slows down a tad because of it, this is a great comedy. It operates in blocks; there are times where it's not that funny, but then it PILES on the laughs over and over again until it repeats the process and goes back to being not as funny. The highs make the lows forgettable for the most part. John Cena was the shit in it.</quote>

  <quote>It could get by on the fact that it was made in 1902 and has this kind of amazing art-design, but it takes a boring subject like travelling to the moon (though obviously not boring at the time) and makes it cool by fighting moon men who explode. It's actually just a solid short, regardless of age, though I wish I could have seen it in 1902 except for the fact if I had I'd be dead right now, thus robbing the world of this review.</quote>

But this movie was really funny, great chemistry between Tucker and Dale; there were genuine moments between them. Great subversive send-up of the genre, clever, awesome premise.</quote>

  <quote>Yeah, I wouldn't say that this is for kids. I mean, most of it is relatively inoffensive these days, but there is some pretty explicit violence and I think the mythology/themes would be lost on kids.

Great animation for the time, the Bright Eyes moment was wonderful and it didn't overstay its welcome. There's also a constant fear here with the characters.</quote>

  <quote>This just felt fun, which I was completely okay with. It didn't require complex characters, just entertaining action and a twisting plot. It had both, so in my eyes it is a huge success. With that said, while I wouldn't say that the characters will be memorable in years to come, I was still into them. Really enjoyed the dialogue and the interactions between people, along with the pretty absurd (and awesome) situations that they were put in, like giving birth during a shootout or that car chase.</quote>

Anyway: Anon and 4chan is just fascinating by itself, as it leaves a lot to discuss just by existing, but where the movie shines is the fact that while it's obviously pro-Anon, it's pretty self-critical in the same way. Being this way allows it to show what it is, and why it's both good and bad in the grand scheme of things. It'd be worse if the whole thing was just YEAH WE FUCKIN' ROCK WE DID THIS!</quote>

  <quote>Not as laugh out loud funny as Thor: Ragnarok a few years later, but this got a lot of little chuckles from me, which I would take over a comedy that only has one or two really good jokes and little else. This means it's pretty consistently funny or at least worth a smile, with fun performances by everyone. Clement and Waititi penned a real gem here that I shouldn't have ignored the year it came out.</quote>

It's a wonderfully paced look at this subculture and the people involved, how playing as someone else can be a release from the everyday shit life. It's funny and tragic.</quote>

  <quote>What kept this from being a 90 and genuinely amazing to me was a bit maybe 3/4 of the way (give or take a bit) through, where I felt it dragged and didn't hold up. The first little while was really funny and well written, then there's this awkward transition period where it went from comedy to drama, and I felt it fell off a bit and didn't transition fluidly, but then it ended in a good way, so it regained its footing. Also, it's nice to see a movie use wrestling as its backdrop. Touching movie.</quote>

Jack Parsons already said &quot;redneck mafia&quot; so I guess I'm not original but that's what I thought while watching this. Great lead performance, great script. Really this film has just about everything going for it. Pretty subtle about the issues it tackles and all the better for it.

  <quote>Emotionally draining. By just filming these inmates and visitors they built their own narrative that just needed to be edited together. The end result is predictable but that's because it's therapy. It doesn't subtract from the experience. Convicts aren't black and white and the movie shows that. There's a scene where a character admits to a certain thing being hokey at first, but he let himself succumb to it and he found satisfaction that he craved. That is this movie in a nutshell.</quote>

  <quote>It's not quite as funny as Hot Fuzz (very little is) and Shaun of the Dead but damn it was a good time. It worked as an apocalyptic action movie and obviously a comedy. The plot was pretty interesting though not really the reason I went anyway, and the social commentary was intriguing. It started off a little slow in terms of laughs and I felt like maybe they lost their edge, but as it went on I found myself consistently laughing. And that's all I wanted from the finale in this trilogy.</quote>

  <quote>A nice look into indie wrestling, or at least how these guys experience it. There is definitely a darker side to wrestling than what is explored here but it's good, as a wrestling fan, to see both sides. These guys love their job and even though it is made clear there's a struggle, they give it their all. They don't do much outside of the ring really, they're kind of what I'd be if I was a wrestler, but the documentary is always interesting.</quote>

I think it's truthful, talking about his beginnings all the way up to now, after his legendary &amp;amp;quot;pipebomb&amp;amp;quot; promo. CM Punk is an interesting guy and I'm a big pro-wrestling guy, so to me, it's really interesting stuff.</quote>

But there's more to this than that... it has great action scenes and commentary, and though time travel is always risky business, it does a pretty good job with it. Probably the best X-Men since the second. But I love the core series as a whole anyway (not the Wolverine spin-offs)</quote>

  <summary>In this exciting prequel to the X-Men series, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) -- the future Professor X and Magneto -- are best friends dedicated to harnessing their powers and promoting the education of fellow mutants during the turbulent 1960s. The duo works together to stop a powerful adversary that threatens mankind, but their ideological differences drive them apart and turn them into ferocious enemies.</summary>
  <quote>Let's not kid ourselves, you're probably watching the movie because you want to see how the friendship between X and Magneto got fucked up... at least if you know anything about them or X-Men. The movie succeeds on that front. Their friendship is done well, and heart breaking, lead by good performances from the two leads. Because of this, it's easier to forgive the cast of mutants (though I understand not having the best from the get go), and the spotty acting some of the other people give.</quote>

  <summary>Kinji Fukasaku directed this powerful and uncompromising look at the deadly stakes of life among the Yakuza -- the Japanese Mafia. Shozo Hirono (Bunta Sugawara) is a former Japanese soldier who, following his nation's defeat in World War II, finds himself in a prison cell in Hiroshima on a murder charge. While behind bars, Hirono gains a loyal friend in fellow criminal Wagasugi (Tatsuo Umemiya), and upon his release Hirono joins Wagasugi in an underworld gang. What starts as a seemingly easy way to earn some quick money becomes something darker and bloodier... (All Movie Guide)</summary>
  <quote>I got Yakuza bias because I'm fascinated by them, and I'm looking forward to watching the other movies in the series. Crazy violent, but not without a sense of (dark) humour. It's hard to follow, especially at the beginning when a lot of people are introduced, but it straightens itself out somewhat. The scheming, the betrayals and the murder are all intriguing, bolstered by an incredible score. It makes room for the sequel, but still ends with a degree of closure (not a bullshit ending).</quote>

It tackles racism in a smart way that doesn't overdue it, has a ton of heart and taps into the love I've had since I was a child for bunnies, effectively making me a sap. The DMV scene was incredible, as was the beginning with the music. But it doesn't quite reach a 90 because some of the pacing is off and there are pauses in the humour at times.</quote>

  <summary>Based on the real life story of canyoneer Aron Ralston, who in 2003 was forced to self-amputate his arm after being stranded and pinned underneath a boulder inside of Bluejohn's Canyon in Utah.</summary>
  <quote>I couldn't help but compare it to Buried so my review will reflect that. This is more stylish and more emotional. I just felt a little more emotionally invested than I did Buried. Buried however, was more intense (because there were no scenes cutting away to help ease what you're watching). Franco also gives a great performance. This is flashier than Buried, with some great camera angles, and ultimately because of the happy ending, it's less gritty and depressing. So it depends on what you want.</quote>

  <summary>A short similar in plot to &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, but more serious. A man is stuck living his life in the same 59 minute time frame. He tries various methods of finding out why, eventually consulting a physicist. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I think the summary sums it up (AS SUMMARIES OFTEN DO). A more serious &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; I think the ending pretty much nails the hopelessness that the main character feels, and because of that it's really powerful.</quote>

  <quote>Beautiful, action was not as disturbing or as graphic as I thought it was going to be. The first hour or so was okay but it kicks it up when the action really starts and you get an extended fight sequence that lasts a good portion of the film... that's when this is at its best. A lot of people die and there's not much of a reason to care, but it's stylish and exciting so who cares? If the first half was better this would be amazing, but there's just a lack of depth during it when it was needed.</quote>

  <summary>Renowned horror novelist Mike Enslin (Cusack) only believes what he can see with his own two eyes. After a string of bestsellers discrediting paranormal events in the most infamous haunted houses and graveyards around the world, he scoffs at the concept of an afterlife. Enslin's phantom-free run of long and lonely nights is about to change forever when he checks into suite 1408 of the notorious Dolphin Hotel for his latest project, &quot;Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms.&quot; (MGM)</summary>
  <quote>Has some eye catching visuals, hardly any gore and an interesting plot. It's not a horror classic or even close but at a time when a lot of movies were just torture porn, this one sticks out as a return to form for horror.</quote>

  <quote>Maybe I'm getting too easy on movies in my old age, but really? I'm one of the few people on here who thinks the movie was just a shit-ton of fun? I mean, Denzel and Wahlberg were just charming as fuck both solo and especially together. The movie was quite funny in certain chunks of it, the plot may have some holes but at least it twisted and turned a bunch. It's by the book in a lot of ways, but this obsession with that being a bad thing boggles my mind. Pure, popcorn entertainment.</quote>

  <quote>&quot;Hi. I have cancer.&quot; Anyway, first off... Anna Kendrick, awesome. Such a cute actress. Gordon-Levitt owned the role again, Rogan did what Rogan does. The movie is very very predictable but I wanted that... honestly I just wanted a feel good moment where he got the right girl, and this is what I got. Plus it's very very funny when it tries to be.  It's also emotional when it wants to be. So really it succeeds on all fronts.</quote>

That's not to say it doesn't get some laughs because it does, just not as many as other people seem to have gotten from it.

After the death of his father, his aging mother and beautiful ex-wife seem to be moving on with their lives. Renewing contact with his initially distrusting family, Ryota struggles to take back control of his existence and to find a lasting place in the life of his young son until a stormy summer night offers them a chance to truly bond again. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Once the three of them are staying together with Ryota's mother (who is a great character) then this really gets going, displaying a humanity and honesty that very few movies can muster. The typhoon sequence in particular is great in its beauty and subtlety. I don't give this higher than an 80 because while it does handle its characters and subject matter effectively, it takes a little too long to get to the brilliance. All in all though it's a great family drama with understated direction.</quote>

Excellent visuals/character/ship design, cinematography; plot may bore some since it's pretty heavy on Prometheus lore, but I wasn't bored with that either. The last few minutes were fine, but final bridge to get to the very end left me a little cold. I also felt they did the Xenomorphs just a teeny bit dirty.</quote>

  <quote>The Imposter was a huge WTF for me and I think it's a better flick, but this is really great too. Because of the choice that Layton made to add the talking head docu element to it there was a level of sympathy/humanity present that may not have been there otherwise. Fiction can definitely hit that and every actor did great, but seeing the real people added something. It's a sloppy heist, but it's also based on reality so can't fault it there. It's a fairly unique heist movie, above all else.</quote>

Denzel is the star in both character and performance, giving genuine life to another role in his career, and the rest of the great cast did what they had to do as well. It's put together well in almost every way; the only real problems is that the script isn't necessarily strong enough to prevent this from feeling a little bloated. You need more from a movie this long.</quote>

  <quote>Definitely a good docu-short. I mean, all you can really expect is to just go somewhere and actually ask the group to represent themselves. That's about as objective as you can get (although editing still makes it subjective). So it succeeds. My own opinions about Juggalos aside, it's nice for people to see how they do see each other as family. The short brings up some questions by showing us rather than telling and there's still stuff to argue about, so that's good.</quote>

The few times it really shot for comedy I thought it had some of the better gags this year, Liman brought an interesting style to it. Just don't expect some substantial masterpiece.</quote>

  <summary>A stoner and his girlfriend's sleepy, small-town existence is disrupted when his past comes back to haunt him in the form of a government operation set to wipe him out. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I liked this a lot more than others it seems. I liked the tone shifting, and the way in which it mashes together its two genres. It isn't wholly original as a comedy or an action movie, but the way in which it balances both is rather unique. It's hard to be bored here, and the comedy worked for me. I also felt that the fight scenes were more inspired than a lot of the bland shit we get.</quote>

  <summary>Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other &quot;female&quot; interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war. (imdb)</summary>

  <summary>Andreiv Rublev charts the life of the great icon painter through a turbulent period of 15th Century Russian history... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It was a beautifully shot film with nice cinematography. It's loosely based on the 15th century Orthodox icon painter, Andrei Rublev, and the setting is wonderful. Really convincing medieval scenery. Religious imagery isn't heavy handed. Even if you're an atheist I think you could appreciate it. The movie also asks some important questions, along with examining how an artist deals with the times.  Even though I wasn't as entertained by it as I could have been, it's still masterfully done.

  <quote>It's not a long movie anyway but time just flew by. Before I knew it I was really invested in these characters. Kaufman explores human interaction, love and relationships in a profoundly intelligent and realistic way... this time using stop-motion animation. Deeply touching and surreal -- plus, it has one of the most intimate sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie.</quote>

  <quote>The extended fight sequence near the end is the obvious highlight, and tbh it really helps in keeping this an 8o. Sometimes the music is overused and the style doesn't match, which dropped it from an 85, but usually that all meshes together and it's incredible to watch. Probably the most inspired fight scenes of the year, since John Wick is more of a shootout. Plot is fine, interesting enough, without the action it would have been more average but the action exists and it's great.</quote>

  <quote>It gets action right, definitely. Ultimately that's basically what it wants to do.

I actually enjoyed watching The Avengers fight each other quite a bit but the last part is equally as satisfying. Why people expect more from this is mind boggling. It'd be nice to have some emotional depth, because it would lift this to a 90, but that's not what it wanted or tried to do. It's pure action</quote>

  <quote>What I like most about this is that it's a nice alternative from movies like John Wick (which I love) where the dude getting revenge is an action star. The farmer is awkward, not good at this, uncomfortable, but his will gets things done, along with some help. Revenge tales usually play out in a similar fashion but there are some cool turns here, like an emotional one where the mom admits to loving someone more than her own son. Shot and acted well, an overlooked film that people should watch.</quote>

  <quote>Definitely a very effective short. It's quite something to think about, how an artist who makes aggressive, loud music must feel after a fan commits a violent act. Even today this kind of thing gets blamed even though for most people it's a relatively peaceful (except maybe at shows, but that's a different story) outlet for their feelings. This short handles its heavy subject matter with finesse, and the lead actor does a good job portraying the different emotions and guilt that he feels.</quote>

Now humanity has lost access to the city's controls, and is hunted down and purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I really enjoy the idea of a city without end, where the builders just keep building shit, and I wish we could have explored more of that. The world is more interesting than what is happening in it, but it's still exciting enough. I do love the animation, which ties into loving the way the world is constructed. Some really dopey/wonky lines and delivery, but some cool musical cues, which in context of the movie add a new dimension. A little confusing in the beginning as well.</quote>

  <summary>A doctor's wife becomes the only person with the ability to see in a town where everyone is struck with a mysterious case of sudden blindness. She feigns illness in order to take care of her husband as her surrounding community breaks down into chaos and disorder. Based on a novel by Nobel Prize winner Jose Saramago. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This movie is all these things: Bleak, sometimes predictable, hopeful, beautiful, ugly, ridiculous, realistic. Which makes it interesting. The acting is good, and so is the music. I found the heart in the movie, and the conflicts that Moore's character face makes sense. The unnamed city looked amazing.</quote>

  <quote>Good chemistry between everybody, Cena puts in great work again (he's really making a name for himself in the film world I think). It set the stage earlier with a great beginning and while it didn't always maintain that level of humour it had enough quality jokes, heartfelt moments and surprising amount of depth to make it maybe not one of the fantastic comedies of all-time... but certainly a great one.</quote>

It's a joyful experience, goes by quick. Wilde pieced the chaos together admirably, injecting a sufficient amount of flair without burying it.</quote>

  <quote>The acting, cinematography, script, direction, sound effects/mixing -- everything about this movie is great except one thing: the music. It makes it seem like an after school special, which it kind of is in terms of its message... but you don't need to make us suffer that mostly awful soundtrack. Still manages to be a deeply emotional film, but how awkward the tone could get at time felt at odds with what it's doing. Change the music and you got yourself a 90.</quote>

There's an odd but endearing soundtrack going on, as well, which also mostly works. Any authorial flaws it has are overshadowed by when it's on point, because it succeeds majorly and only fails minorly. A pretty original vision all around.</quote>

  <quote>Technically pretty marvelous: the camera work is very deliberate and creates a great mood, the bass-heavy score is tremendous, the acting is really good and it covers some social issues well. It's an incredibly slow-burn and I'm conflicted: at times there's a reward to the pacing but then it also manages to drag on occasion, simultaneously revealing its secrets too slightly and just right. It's still a great movie, though I wish I could find the same passion for it that others clearly have.</quote>

Feels genuine due to Mazzei's experience in this world, Brewer really helped realize the character. The final act left a little to be desired which is sometimes the case when mysteries are revealed, but the final scene brought it back. An ominous horror atmosphere but no jump scares to punctuate it, but that's fine.</quote>

Yo-Landi, Dev, and Ninja all do a great job, Jackman is expendable, but Copley is the star here as Chappie. Some of the tone shifts don't work.

  <summary>Cosmopolis is a day in the life of Eric Packer, a 28-year-old New York stock market multi-millionaire, as he crosses Manhattan in his customized limousine to go for a haircut. His cross-town journey becomes an almost vertical voyage, with bizarre occurrences and an authentic parade of crazy characters along the way, in a landscape that depicts the modern soul of the West at the end of the millennium (mubi.com)</summary>
  <quote>It's a pretty cold and detached film, with the general feel and the dialogue, which is unnatural at times, literary and symbolic. I think that in this particular type of movie, that works. I was never going to feel bad for the main character due to political reasons. However, the movie knows this I reckon, and somehow draws you into its world, and is interesting the entire time, with a nice ending. Cronenberg is a talented director who pieced this dense film together wonderfully.</quote>

  <summary>When Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) discovers that his wife (Julianne Moore) wants to end their marriage, he reluctantly faces the unwelcome prospect of single life with the counsel of the younger and smoother super-bachelor Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling). Meanwhile, Cal's adolescent son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), has formed an unquenchable crush on his 17-year-old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) -- but is she more interested in Robbie's recently unwed father?</summary>
  <quote>Shifts moods, pretty much succeeds whenever it does. I have liked Gosling a lot for a while and this year he's come into his own and has been gettin' respect, but everybody is good here. My favourite part was near the end when people were at the same house: by far the funniest part of the movie.</quote>

I don't know if it's the delivery sometimes that makes it less funny, or the fact I'm just not really shocked or amused by intentionally offensive stuff.

  <summary>Near Penn Station, next to the Amtrak tracks, squatters have been living for years. Marc Singer goes underground to live with them, and films this &quot;family.&quot; A dozen or so men and one woman talk about their lives: horrors of childhood, jail time, losing children, being coke-heads. They scavenge, they've built themselves sturdy one-room shacks; they have pets, cook, chat, argue, give each other haircuts. A bucket is their toilet. Leaky overhead pipes are a source of water for showers. They live in virtual darkness. During the filming, Amtrak gives a 30-day eviction notice. (imdb)</summary>

Everytime the Alchemist showed up it was entertaining. Most of the music was good but there was a moment or two where it was wonky.</quote>

  <quote>The movie is pretty consistently funny, with some real hilarious moments. For the movie it's a more stretched out crazy as they aren't jamming a shit-ton in 2-3 min segments. It's still fast paced and crazy, and a lot of shit happens in the hour and 15 minutes that it lasts. The raccoon is the funniest part of the movie, but the rest of the people hold their own and the creators do a wonderful job making the movie epic in scope. For fans of the show, this is a huge winner.</quote>

Anyway, sometimes Marvel cuts the nuts off their villains with unnecessary attempts at comedy (because heaven forbid they're too serious) that briefly break my immersion, and this isn't overly funny, but the Doctor is awesome, the story is fine, the visuals are outstanding and the environmental manipulation makes for truly exciting action.

  <quote>All 3 segments, which are quite different in tone and plot, share a wonderful atmosphere, which sci-fi movies should. The first segment is a good look at the zombie genre. The second segment (the highlight of the film), is a look at robots and philosophy, an interesting dissection of humans and creation. The third is a pretty silly look at the apocalypse and pool, but after the seriousness in the previous, it was a nice break. All in all the two directors succeed wonderfully in all 3 parts.</quote>

  <quote>The thing is, it's hard to examine this issue in a movie, especially a fiction one, because it's not simple. The East does a great job of trying though. I understand anarchism so most movies frustrate me with how they portray anarchists. They do a decent job here. It clearly targets corporate America so in that way yes it is slanted, but that's okay, especially if you agree. Ultimately it's a good political thriller that's as human as it can be, it's tense and exciting, and makes people think.</quote>

  <quote>I've never read the book this is based on but having now read some analysis on Enemy the potential themes are a lot more clear. It's probably about living under a totalitarian government without knowing it, and Denis subtly shows this in the environment and in the way he contrasts the doubles. This made me appreciate the film more than I did originally. Anyway, Jake put in a good performance as usual and Denis created an atmosphere full of dread as usual.</quote>

  <quote>Probably about a 70 for &quot;enjoyment,&quot; but I up it a lot more for just being original and in a league of its own. Though I actually kind of got into it more near the end, which I guess is strange because the consensus seems to be that if you think it falls apart, it's after 90 minutes. The visuals are like a drug-induced haze, which makes sense, and it all feels so dreamy it's hard not to feel at least a little captivated by it all. I'll probably  never watch it twice though. It was kinda scary 2.</quote>

It's shallow on the surface but there is a genuine heart beating below with the way these friends have each others backs, which keeps the endless cameos and sex from becoming typical fluff. It's one of the funnier movies of the year and while early reviews have not been amazing, I really enjoyed myself.</quote>

  <quote>Thoughtful with a great score. It uses excellent dialogue to ask some nice questions about AI and existence, while it is certainly a great feminist film in the sense that both of the main characters (played well by Isaac and Gleeson, respectively) try to impact her life and she's like, &quot;Nah, fuck it, I'ma look how I want and do what I want.&quot; It doesn't quite hit that level of 90 where I was absolutely in love, but it's definitely a smart, humane, beautifully shot and GREAT movie.</quote>

(imdb)</summary>
  <quote>1: I laughed at the beginning, &quot;This isn't Gone with the Wind.&quot; 2: I love Banksy and street-art. 3: I've heard a lot of reviewers saying this isn't a real documentary but who knows? I think the point is that there is some social commentary in here about art turning into commerce, and even if this isn't totally factual (what docu is?), it makes a completely valid point. Though I went in expecting something else, I learned to appreciate the experiment of this.</quote>

  <quote>This is a movie I wish I had more space to write about it. First of all, the lead character is wonderful... this movie doesn't just use September 11 as some trite plot device, it's a backdrop and something that affected many. To those critics who actually found that offensive, fuck off. This is a touching tale that actually looks at autism in an interesting way. If the main character is &quot;grating&quot; to some, that's the point. Try living with autism or someone with it.</quote>

Stacy Keach is Tully, a down-on-his-luck alcoholic boxer earning money as a field worker while trying for a comeback. Tully tries to pass his wisdom on to Ernie (Jeff Bridges), his 18-year-old protégé, attempting to give the kid the chances he missed.</summary>
  <quote>Very gritty and realistic, with great performances by Bridges and Keach. The ending was great and subtle; a perfect reflection on what transpired over the course of the film. It's probably what made me put it over to an 80. The character arcs could have used a little more fleshing out, but besides that, the script is well done. Though Trully and Ernie only interact once in a while, the movie is stronger because it showcases the different paths. When the ending comes it's more poignant that way.</quote>

I didn't find it as funny or as touching as some of the other Pixar movies, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have funny or touching moments because the end got to me a bit and the biggest laugh for me was a fart joke.

  <quote>Slow but uses silence and music well. Props to Carrell, especially, but Tatum and Ruffalo were awesome as well. Interesting drama, better than I originally expected because I wasn't really thrilled to see it. A little shocking, and pretty emotional as well.</quote>

  <quote>I think CatrelS sums up my feelings here but I'll add a bit more. It's a pretty &quot;out there&quot; idea and while it doesn't always stick, it's still daring and we should appreciate movies like this. It was ambitious. The score was great, the Meanwhile City parts were better than the normal world and while some of it was wonky, it's a good flick. Flesh out the themes and characters a little more, work on the pacing a bit and it would have been a 85-90.</quote>

  <quote>Obviously have love for the chase scene like everybody else does. This is a great thriller but I'm not in love with it. Hackman puts in a good performance, it does take its time but ultimately pays off which is necessary. I think the ending is amazing though, him running into a room and then there's just a gunshot and there's that eerie music playing. Didn't really expect that.</quote>

  <quote>I'm giving both the same ranking but they're sort of different. The first had more action and weirder boss battles and raised questions. This one doesn't have as much action and the couple bosses are more normal, but the story breathes more and tries to answer questions. It doesn't answer it fully which some critics noted but I like that it's sort of vague. Too often we're just gifted answers. Very entertained by these Wuxia/Saw/Sci-Fi/ hybrids.

  <quote>Gugino put this on her back, which was always going to be the necessity for any actress taking on the role. She handled it wonderfully. I actually love the book and think this is a good adaptation of it; it's still better as a book but I was into this and once you get past the gimmicky nature in which Gerald is in the movie then it's an effective drama. Unlike many others, I actually think the twist at the end makes it creepy and puts a good spin on what we've already seen.</quote>

  <quote>I'm not a Peele fan, but he took something that could have just been silly and made it compelling. The best part is the build, which lasts most of the movie, because it throws in a little comedy but is ultimately intense and creepy, without relying on jump scares. The last act didn't do it for me as much, and sometimes the script lacked polish as a whole, but it did end with a great line. Well acted, good atmosphere, strong directorial sense... not a masterpiece but damn good, almost an 85.</quote>

  <quote>I can finally knock this one off my blasphemy list. I think there was definitely some funny moments--such as Murray, who I'm not a huge fan of--and the special effects would have been great for their time. The theme song is undeniably legendary, and it's a thoroughly entertaining and classic flick that I will not deny its proper place in history. It is a fun horror-comedy that is much better than a lot of movies in the same genre, but I can't view it as the sacred cow that some do.</quote>

  <quote>Don't think I'll ever really care to watch this again. It is a very pretty movie and has some really interesting writing. The fact it's really current and deeply buried within this time makes it resonate a bit more. Sure, years from now it might not hold up in that sense but as a glimpse in a period of time, it's fantastic (and that's all I need...). But I really didn't ENJOY the movie as much as I hoped.

  <summary>Astronauts attempt to return to earth after debris crashes into their space shuttle, leaving them drifting alone in space. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>You definitely see this in a theatre because the visuals and cinematography are outstanding. Everything else about it is decent. There are some real hammy moments, but you come to this to see people lost in space, struggling, and it succeeds at that big time. Space/gravity (or lack of) is the best villain of all time, because some of it was just downright scary. With that said, I'm not feeling it on a personal level like some. It's still a great experience though. Just not quite a 90 for me.</quote>

  <summary>In Alaska, an oil drilling team struggle to survive after a plane crash strands them in the wild. Hunting the humans are a pack of wolves who see them as intruders. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The plane crash was astounding. So what you get here is an artsy, introspective movie about a bunch of guys stuck in the cold being hunted by wolves. It's actually pretty terrifying sometimes, like listening to the wolves as the men stand in darkness with only a fire protecting them. It's pretty gruesome, doesn't bullshit, but is genuinely touching and emotional. It's shot beautifully and it sets it above your average Hollywood flick. Plus the ending is awesome.</quote>

  <quote>They try a little too hard early on (with Drax, mostly), but there are still a lot of amazing jokes (especially from Rocket). So while it may have more jokes that don't hit, it still has a ton that do, and it has more heart, more emotion, along with better action sequences. And this time around they have Ego, who is a much better villain. After reconsidering though, I think I like the first one a little more. Guardians to me is a comedy first and foremost and the first does that better.</quote>

(Sony)</summary>
  <quote>Sure, thematically it's rather insubstantial, instead simply being a mood piece, a solid crime drama, with understated acting that serves the end goal wonderfully. The simple plot is drenched in atmosphere, showcasing PTA's talent early. He came back to this kind of thing with Inherent Vice later on, where it's not necessarily &quot;important&quot; but I come out of thinking that was a damn good time, which is completely fine.</quote>

  <quote>I love that it isn't about a dysfunctional black family for once. Stenberg puts in a wonderful performance. It was incredibly emotional too many times to count. I like what it's saying, I like how it goes in hard on what it's trying to say. But it can be a little hokey, mostly in the bookends, but there were times where I thought it was going to give a more in-depth examination of issues we know of but it kind of cheaps out. But it's based on a YA novel so I guess that's understandable.</quote>

  <quote>I quite enjoyed it but it felt a little off to me. I think the first couple chapters risked going into tedious territory -- but never quite making it there -- while the chapters afterward became a lot more compelling. Some of the humour just felt weird this time around, and the plot is too thin to be as long as it is. However, it's shot in a stylish and beautiful way (with the scenery being incredible) and all these actors are wonderful when the dialogue works (which is most of the time).</quote>

  <summary>A city in southern China and a bag containing a million yuan draws several people from diverse backgrounds with different personal motives into a bloody conflict. Philosophising gangster bosses, ageing hitmen, men and women who are tired of the struggle to survive - anyone who happens to have the bag holds on to it tightly, as if it were a lifeline. Hao ji le is a black comedy; the film's inscrutable, laconic humour holds up a magnifying glass to attitudes to life and social conditions... (berlinale.de)</summary>
  <quote>If you are willing to give yourself to the slow pace, which somehow exists even though there's quite a bit of story packed in and it's not a long movie, then there's a lot to like here. The opening credits, showcasing the city, accompanied by an excellent song, made me believe I would fall in love with this but it does lose a little as it goes on. A lot happening but nothing too original, but the animation is great in its simplicity. Some of the characters were neat too, like Skinny.</quote>

  <quote>Although there wasn't as much action as I would have hoped, and some of the parts were a little TOO cheesy (some cheese is expected), I still think it's worthy of being considered great. The non-fighting parts weren't incredibly deep but there were some tense interactions, some humour and decent characterization for what this is. I wasn't bored during it, but like I said I would have welcomed more fighting. The ending was a little hokey but the battle up until then was satisfying.</quote>

  <summary>Clint Eastwood directs this supernatural thriller about three very different people and their responses to death, including a hesitant American psychic named George (Matt Damon) who may be able to help the others find answers and peace. Marie (Cécile De France) is a French journalist caught up in the aftereffects of the devastating 2004 tsunami, while in London, young Marcus (Frankie McLaren) seeks to contact his deceased twin brother.</summary>
  <quote>It uses its slow, deliberate pace to tell a story much like -- as someone else said -- Babel does, only I liked this more than I liked Babel. 2 of the 3 stories really fascinated me, but the one with Marie I wasn't real thrilled about (except for the amazing beginning). It doesn't offer a lot of solace, or answers, by the end but it leaves you wondering, and basking in the beauty of what you've just seen.</quote>

He takes a room and decides to stay. Meanwhile, a group of outlaws are about to return to the town and take their revenge - will the towns leaders convince the mysterious man to help?

  <quote>What prevents this from being amazing is just that it's slow at the beginning and a little derivative. Eastwood's character is impossible to like but when the movie ends you realize that's kind of the point: as others have noted, it's both surreal and a horror western. The plot twist is obvious, but since it's a ghost revenge tale, it makes sense that he's an unflinching bastard with a singular purpose. I also love the eerie choice of music that plays occasionally. Excellent cinematography.</quote>

  <quote>For a dystopian movie that wanted to stay teen-ish, this was really really solid. They could have covered the topics it tries to address a little more and the actual Hunger Games wasn't as brutal as it should have been, and yes it ends up being very Hollywood and I hope it doesn't end up being Twilight-ish... but you know, I was into this a lot. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Dystopias and Lawrence, but the movie was kind of gritty and entertaining. Camera work was annoying at times though.</quote>

  <quote>I've never read the books, but god damn I love these movies. Since the series is &quot;young adult,&quot; it's obviously not going to be as gritty as perhaps it could be, but I don't even care about that. What matters is that while the dystopia isn't the best ever, it is still good and interesting. But it's the characters and relationships that put it up to a 90. The actual games are still interesting, it has a great cliffhanger, Lawrence (and everyone) was great. This is YA done right.</quote>

  <summary>Following a banal incident in her local village, 8-year old girl Shula is accused of witchcraft. After a short trial she is found guilty, taken into state custody and exiled to a witch camp in the middle of a desert. At the camp she takes part in an initiation ceremony where she is shown the rules surrounding her new life as a witch. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This gets labelled a drama but there is a general feeling of awkwardness that is usually present in effective comedic satire that keeps you at a healthy distance. But in turn this has a bunch of funny moments that hit me pretty hard. It doesn't necessarily hit its subject matter as hard as it does its humour, but I don't think it needed to in order to be really entertaining. I enjoy the ending, the cinematography and the girl who played Shula said quite a bit while verbally saying very little.</quote>

  <summary>Barbara Thorson struggles through life by escaping into a fantasy life of magic and monsters. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Nice little low-budget fantasy movie that doesn't look cheap. Credit to Walters who realizes what he can and cannot do and only shows things when he has to. Madison Wolfe, who played Barbara, does a really good job here. For the most part it's written well and while the allegory is pretty easy to connect, I was okay with it. It did it well, until the end where it got a little hokey and blunt, losing some of the subtleness. But the emotional highs still hit and I really liked this.</quote>

  <summary>A story of Naoufel, a young man who is in love with Gabrielle. In another part of town, a severed hand escapes from a dissection lab, determined to find its body again.</summary>
  <quote>I felt for the hand. This was quite a beautiful movie, particularly in two aspects: the animation and the music. Both are superb. Maybe without the hand this would seem like a lesser, more normal movie, but the hand is there so it counts. Watching it traverse the city was actually really exciting and emotional. It's just a shame that the non-hand stuff isn't quite as compelling, even if it is a fairly thoughtful reflection on fate, love, etc.</quote>

  <quote>Plaza puts on a show here, portraying a social media obsessed woman in such a dynamic way that it is easy to be a little scared of her but also feel sorry for her. Aside from her the movie is a pretty on point satire of the dangers of trying to be social media famous and the risks of becoming someone you're really not. Never boring, shot well, but really you come for Plaza.</quote>

Good special effects, watching the aliens clone was gross, if this wasn't paced like it was then it would be much better... but even still it's pretty great.</quote>

Mandarin is much more interesting than the villain in the 2nd. The humour is on point... the tone is serious but not too serious, which the first nailed and this one nails too. It's not tackling big issues, it's just promising you fun, and that's more than enough.</quote>

  <quote>I'll give it an 80 to mean I think it's &quot;great&quot; but I'm a little disappointed. The acting is wooden at times, but I love the excellent soundtrack by Disasterpeace, which makes it feel retro and creep. I also love that the movie is different than most others. The pool scene fell a little flat. It had great cinematography and maintained a sense of dread throughout, but it wasn't cripplingly so... which is a problem 'cuz I think the premise might be better than the execution. Shoulda been scarier.</quote>

Phoenixs' Joker is a really good performance by a really good actor. It's shot wonderfully, it's different from other &quot;superhero&quot; movies, explores mental health well. I just wish the first little while of it was a little more enticing.</quote>

It's still darker, has a bigger comic book feel, but it does have more jokes, which mostly work. Great casting all around with great chemistry, fun action. Sure the villain isn't as good as it could have been, but almost every superhero movie has that problem... Steppenwolf is FINE, ultimately, enough to be menacing.

Great music choice and great scene when Frank finds out about Big Daddy. Action is inspired, movie is kinda funny but not overly (few good laughs).

If you want an intense movie with pitch-black humor that will probably manage to make you uncomfortable at least once, check this out.</quote>

  <summary>An epic 12-year journey into the brutal and secretive world of Irish Traveler bare-knuckle fighting. This film follows a history of violent feuding between rival clans. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Interesting look into Travellers. It's pretty sad when you think about this massive family torn apart for so long, and the amount of hate. The fights themselves might surprise people who think they're unorganized because they have refs and other rules.</quote>

  <summary>Halla, the fifties, declares war to the local industry of the aluminum, which disfigures her country. She takes all the risks to protect the high lands of Iceland - But the situation could change with the unexpected arrival of a small orphan in her life. (Hugo Van Herpe)</summary>
  <quote>A treat to look at because it captures the landscapes wonderfully. I'm such a sucker for how this is shot. Pretty funny at times (the band didn't get old for me) but I wouldn't say it's that much of a comedy--unless the humour is just TOO dry for me to notice it. But the drama was well done. Good lead performance as well.</quote>

  <summary>A Korean man is sentenced to death by hanging, but he survives the execution. For the following two hours, his executioners try to work out how to handle the situation in this black farce. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It started off really brilliantly and managed to maintain that for a fairly sizable chunk of its runtime. Watching Watanabe as the education officer, in particular, was an absolute treat. He sold the absurdity well. It was funny and smart with a cool premise. However, the final bit lost me some, even as it touched on some important issues. Just kind of lost its momentum, became maybe a little too out there for what had been set up. It didn't tank it by any means, but I enjoyed it less.</quote>

  <summary>An intimate and moving meditation on the late musician and artist Kurt Cobain, based on more than 25 hours of previously unheard audiotaped interviews conducted with Cobain by noted music journalist Michael Azerrad for his book &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana.&quot; In the film, Kurt Cobain recounts his own life - from his childhood and adolescence to his days of musical discovery and later dealings with explosive fame - and offers often piercing insights into his life, music, and times...

  <summary>The authorized documentary on late Guitar/lead singer Kurt Cobain from his early days in Aberdeen Washington to his success and downfall with Grunge band Nirvana.</summary>
  <quote>Unreleased material, along with the interviews with his mom, dad, and sister are all good. Always nice to see more of Kurt. This isn't a docu for people who want info dumps though: very little of it is new information. But it is a personal affair due to the way it incorporates Kurts own noodlings and thoughts, his artwork, and animation made for the movie. It's more of a collage than anything else and is incredibly creative. But sometimes scenes go on way too long and lose luster.</quote>

  <summary>The film is a road movie in which three aging Vietnam-era Navy vets--soft-spoken Doc (Steve Carell), unhinged and unfiltered Sal (Bryan Cranston), and quietly measured Mueller (Laurence Fishburne)--reunite to perform a sacred task: the proper burial of Doc's only child, who has been killed in the early days of the Iraqi invasion. (deadline.com)</summary>
  <quote>Fishburne, Carell and Cranston all put in solid work here. There were a few chuckles, but don't mistake this as a comedy: it's a solemn meditation on life, death and country. What I like most about it is that it's not Jingoist, instead painting war/government in the rightful way... something that most films revolving around the military fail to do. This is very human storytelling, condemning certain things while also embracing the sacrifices that people make for what they believe.</quote>

  <summary>A father and his 13 year-old daughter are living in a paradisiacal existence in a vast urban park in Portland Oregon when a small mistake derails their lives forever. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Not a whole lot happens but it builds itself organically, focusing on the relationship between father and daughter. No crazy moments or action, just a simple tale done well. Foster and McKenzie (especially her) put in really great work, and the direction is top-notch. Nice touch to just have visuals of a forest in the credits. There are films this year that I enjoy more, but very few that hit such an emotional depth: not even bombastically, it's a quiet, powerful sadness that hits the core.</quote>

If you've seen the original you don't have much of a reason to see it, but at the same time, it IS a great movie. Not as good, but still definitely worth your time.</quote>

  <quote>It took 10-15 minutes to do ANYTHING (seriously, it was mostly just a story being told) and I thought I was going to hate this, but then after that the slow pace won me over and it never committed anything that bad again. I felt for the dad and his kid, thought it was tense when it had to be, good music and cinematography. I guess it doesn't do anything that substantial or original but what it does it does well, minus the beginning. The last line of dialogue was really touching.</quote>

  <quote>Movies like Phone Booth and Buried used a similar setup where their self-mandated limitations forced them to come up with an intriguing plot/story. They were thrillers about people forced to deal with extraordinary circumstances. Locke is different... it's about a guy driving to London having normal conversations (compared to those other movies). It's interesting watching Hardy give a great performance as a guy whose life is unravelling. It's very human and well-written.</quote>

  <quote>It was a joy watching Gould play private eye detective Marlowe in such a deadpan/unexpressive way; it actually added to his character, made him more charming and humorous. Even by the end it just adds to it. Aside from that great performance, the plot left me a little disappointed, however Altman's direction is on point, showcasing the loose plot in a moody way. Loved the first third of the movie especially and that's got a lot to do with his conversations with the cat and with cops.</quote>

Seeing the portfolio might be more beneficial because then you can examine the pics without having to pause the movie.

  <quote>Definitely liked it and see the talent involved, specifically De Niro (but Keitel was certainly great as well). Scorsese expertly shot this with some nice symbolic shots and usage of colour and music. Not in love with it, it's a little rough sometimes, but it's good enough to be considered a &quot;great&quot; flick, even if it's at the lower end of that classification in my eyes.</quote>

  <summary>Memento chronicles two separate stories of Leonard (Guy Pearce), a ex-insurance investigator who can no longer build new memories, as he attempts to find the murderer of his wife, which is the last thing he remembers. One story line movies forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time. (imdb) [Released at some festivals in 2000]</summary>

  <quote>Masterfully builds a sense of mystery, never divulging too much info or getting lost in pointless exposition; instead it uses its beautiful cinematography, music and acting to tell a story about a kid with superpowers. If you want answers, you're missing the point: we are thrown into the same shoes as the characters, the ambiguity is crucial. Also, MS drifts into some minor horror territory due to how grave certain things feel, but is a sci-fi flick at its core definitely. Wonderful road movie.</quote>

  <quote>Aster is a brilliant director and the cinematography is on point. The way the flick is framed, the different and unusual camera angles, the usage of colour (and the contrast with darker material)… it's all fantastic. This isn't as good as Hereditary though because it doesn't have the same level of lead performances, and it doesn't build the drama as effectively. I bought into Hereditary more before shit hit the fan than I did this. Lots of memorable and inspired imagery here.</quote>

  <quote>Took a while for it to click with me but it did eventually. There's something really satisfying about Vincent Cassel watching videos about the Illuminati for half the movie. Aside from that it's a caper that doesn't do anything that special from a narrative standpoint, but it's a subgenre I enjoy. Gavras brought his music video experience to this and elevates the film with the inclusion of some pretty fitting music, showcasing the power that can be achieved by perfectly marrying music/visuals.</quote>

  <quote>The marketing was dogshit. This is not a horror movie; it's told through an ominous lens and has imagery that is reminiscent of that genre, but it is not horror. Excellent sound design and acting work all around. It is a spectacle, especially the last half hour when everything is chaotic. It is at that moment that the secrets reveal themselves; it's thoughtful and metaphorical, but the allegory is not quite as complex as some think. Still great even if it's not as good as most of his other work.</quote>

It's not really like other prison movies in the sense that it's not terribly graphic or violent, though there are scenes of that. It uses what little violence it has to make a different point, anyway. Schoenaerts was really great here. There was a lot of passion on display here and genuine warmth from how the story and characters develop. Plus, just any movie about a bond between animal and human gets me.</quote>

  <quote>I think I can give this a slight edge to hit 80 because if you want just a stoner comedy this hits on all fronts. The chemistry between Mitchell and Morrone is front and center, and they're able to carry the film; really, them doing anything is a pleasure to watch. As glumpy said, it's so fast-paced that there really isn't time to get bored. And yet it doesn't overload the viewer, which is key. Some pretty funny jokes, though not the funniest movie I've ever seen by any means.</quote>

  <quote>Kind of funny because it is so over the top, but that's the point. We take and we take and when we're done we just go somewhere else and take some more, and Villeneuve expresses this sentiment with his trademark attention to detail and style, even if this is obviously more restrained than what he would go on to do. Nice to see that in 2008 he was making interesting musical choices. Time to dig into more of his stuff.</quote>

  <summary>&quot;November&quot; is based on Estonian novel &quot;Rehepapp&quot; by Andrus Kivirähk, a bestseller of the last twenty years. The film is a mixture of magic, black humor and romantic love. The story is set in a pagan Estonian village where werewolves, the plague, and spirits roam. The villagers' main problem is how to survive the cold, dark winter. And, to that aim, nothing is taboo. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The story isn't always there, it kind of meanders a bit, but this is a feast in other ways. The stark, powerful whites that Sarnet used created a harsh atmosphere and the visuals in general are just a blast to see. It's an unapologetically odd movie, especially to those (like me) who aren't steeped in Estonian mythology. It's because of the imagery, cinematography and direction that it can overcome it's relatively weak story and be great. B/W really helped set the tone here, too.</quote>

It's not the great documentary of our time by any means, but it's an interesting look at a guy who... well, certainly did some shit. Plus it makes for a fun talking piece: hey, you know about that guy who used to do surgery with goat testicles? You do now!</quote>

A little long, probably could have trimmed some of the melodrama, but it's a great flick.</quote>

Besides that it's fun but the ground it covers is not as good as some other Pixar: it's not as funny as some, not as exciting as others, etc. Still a great flick, though admittedly it was a 75 until I was hit with feels.</quote>

  <summary>A young Peruvian bear with a passion for all things British travels to London in search of a home. Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington Station, he begins to realize that city life is not all he had imagined - until he meets the kindly Brown family, who read the label around his neck ('Please look after this bear. Thank you.') and offer him a temporary haven. It looks as though his luck has changed until this rarest of bears catches the eye of a museum taxidermist. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Charming and moving with some genuine laughs. It's not exactly Pixar but it is actually fun for everybody. For kids, but just adult enough for older people. Once the action gets heavier at the end it loses a little steam but it's still good entertainment as a whole.</quote>

  <quote>This was pretty great. It didn't have anything to push it over to make me go WOW, but it was really solid the entire way through, with good acting, a good story. It was nice to see how this thriller would pan out. Didn't have to rely on action or anything, just a solid story.</quote>

  <summary>The Passion of The Christ focusses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus has gone to pray after sitting the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death.

  <quote>Sometimes a movie comes along that might not technically be amazing but it is such a warm, sweet movie that it's fun to just go along for the ride. This is that. Gottsagen is the one most talked about--deservedly so--but everybody is good here. Doesn't break new ground from a narrative perspective but it was entertaining throughout, didn't overstay its welcome. The chemistry between Shia and Zack is great, and the relationship between the characters is wonderful.</quote>

  <quote>It takes its time setting up the family and that paid off because I actually cared about them. There wasn't any forced drama, just a loving and sympathetic family trying to make ends meet. Then things get spooky and we are treated to some really great jump scares and a tense atmosphere (the house itself is perfectly built to freak people out with a creepy portrait, long hallways, etc) but also a nice twist on the genre. Pretty cool story in general.</quote>

  <summary>An absurdist, surrealistic and shocking pitch-black comedy, which moves freely from nightmare to fantasy to hilariously deadpan humour as it muses on man's perpetual inhumanity to man. (tmdb.com)</summary>
  <quote>Can be a little slow at times, but the awkward acting is great. People look and act bored because that's the point. The use of static camera won't appeal to all but that's Andersson's trademark. Clever tragicomedy on display here, with the King being the highlight of the film. One of the final scenes is pretty depressing as well. It shifts tones whenever it feels like it.</quote>

  <quote>I think any shortcomings that it has are forgiven by how gorgeous this is. I'm a real sucker for atmospheric shots of wilderness, especially wide ones, and this has that in spade. Basically, yeah, nature looks astounding. Also, Bernthal is a badass so it has that going for it, and despite Holland not doing a whole lot, he's pretty sympathetic. Some excellent violence here that isn't fancy, unlike some movies that would make longer choreography. Here it is just blunt and to the point.</quote>

  <quote>I thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything just worked. The humour was on point, the CGI was great, the story was interesting enough, Reynolds was good as Pikachu. Had some heart, some fun action, a good premise. It does this thing that a lot of comedies do where it mostly abandons humour for the final battle (and admittedly the film is weakest here), but that doesn't undo the fun mystery, emotion and comedy that preceded it. And it's not like the battle was TERRIBLE.</quote>

  <quote>I was pretty impressed by this. The puppet was especially creepy but never felt overused, there were genuine scares here but even when it wasn't actively scaring me it had a tense, otherworldly atmosphere that never let me get my bearings. Both actors were really good but Harris was the better of the two for sure. Fantastic music really hammered the tone home. Can be a little hard to follow but that felt intentional, layering weirdness onto its disturbing--but all too real--plot and themes.</quote>

  <quote>Sides with the Left, but I don't think it's that far-fetched. People do talk like this, even now. It's a lot of info to put into an hour and a half, meaning you can't go into the kind of detail that would justify either side, really. Pretty gritty movie with good acting, I believe it can encourage conversation, though it won't break any stereotypes so in that sense it could set it back a bit. Still, it's a starting point. You put people in stressful situations and they act accordingly.</quote>

  <quote>Pretty much a given that at least Kidman or Eckhart get nominations. Personally I preferred Eckhart, though I wouldn't hate if Kidman got the only nom. I enjoyed the more positive ending, the stuff with parallel universes and believing in science vs God. It's actually a pretty subtle, but relatively fresh, take on this kind of movie. The scene where it was revealed who killed Danny was understated but really moving. I guess that's where this movie delivers... heavy subject matter in a subtle way</quote>

  <summary>When Jake LaMotta steps into a boxing ring and obliterates his opponent, he's a prizefighter portrayed in this Martin Scorsese film by Robert De Niro. But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I guess I'm just not huge into Scorsese. I rarely connect with his movies like others seem to. I can't knock him really. I can't knock De Niro in this. I can't knock the boxing scenes which are incredible and larger than life and work well with the out of ring scenes. I just... don't connect somehow.

I wasn't amazed by this movie at any point but it does have a certain playfulness with its satire that mixes uncommonly well with pretty brutal violence. That's not an easy tonal shift to make. The action itself is never that inspired but it's more forgivable because it's not JUST an action movie, it's legitimate commentary as well.</quote>

  <summary>A modern-day story about the boundless love between mother and child; young Jack knows nothing of the world except for the single room in which he was born and raised. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Really emotional stuff that deals with life trapped in a single room and then the painful reality/after effects of leaving said room. Larson was wonderful, and so was Tremblay. Macy was in it for such a short period of time but said so much.</quote>

  <quote>I'm still not sick of post-apocalyptic movies, and that's kinda special. This one is incredibly bleak and brutal. It doesn't have some huge plot, no huge conspiracy, just a simple moment in time, a guy chasing down the people who took his car with the help of one of the brothers of the people he's hunting. It's like a snapshot of the post-apocalyptic world, wonderfully acted by the two leads. The violence is much like Drive... intense and sudden, with impact. Great road trip/post-apoc movie.</quote>

  <quote>More &quot;damp&quot; than overly depressing (it's pretty funny at times), this is a richly detailed world and characterization isn't always easy to pick up on but it's there amongst the long, atmospheric shots. Though it didn't get to me as much as Werckmeister Harmonies, it's still an emotional film with a bunch of memorable scenes. I especially loved the doctor. This is a fantastic film but on occasion I couldn't get as into what was happening as I had hoped.</quote>

  <quote>Hey, non-Arcade Fire fan here (not for any particular reason), chiming in... This hits the idea of growing up and growing apart perfectly.

But Zhang displays a dedication to the idea of shadows, both as a type of person and an aesthetic; it's very grim and dark, not much colour, represents the life of a shadow. Beautiful photography, directing, some memorable scenes. I appreciate the artistic choice but it doesn't pop like Daggers or Hero.</quote>

Unlike most comic book movies, this actually feels like a comic book and doesn't just use the characters. I love me other CB movies, but it's nice to have a change like this.</quote>

It tried to undo good will that it built. I do love Reynor as brother Brendan.</quote>

  <quote>Though I get sick of the premise (people move into house, get haunted), I felt like Sinister handled it well. It built a good story about a true-crime novelist, and it even raised questions about the idea of whether he's doing it for fame or to battle injustice, which I appreciated. It was sufficiently creepy and disturbing, with great Super 8 short films that were easily the best part. A wonderful blend of original music and great bands, and the movie didn't rely on gore.

  <summary>Jackson Maine (Cooper), a country music star on the brink of decline, discovers a talented unknown named Ally (Germanotta). As the two begin a passionate love affair, Jackson coaxes Ally into the spotlight, catapulting her to stardom. But as Ally's career quickly eclipses his own, Jack finds it increasingly hard to handle his fading glory. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This is overblown by people but it's still a great movie. While the plot itself is pretty basic and could probably have been trimmed a tad, this is about the music and the performances. The only songs that don't hit are the stupid pop ones, ironically, because Gaga has done better on her records, but the rest are fantastic. Gaga proves she can act and Cooper proves he can sing/direct, though the direction isn't outstanding. The cut back to Bradley during the final song got my eyes leaking.</quote>

  <quote>Still has flaws, like hokey dialogue, but the action feels fuller and more exciting (partially due to the great soundtrack), the story was on-point, and there are some memorable scenes like when everyone is turning on the Jedis. Hayden goes from being entertaining to being a tree a bunch of times throughout but I don't think he was terrible as a whole. Great sfx. I think people blow small problems out of proportion. For example, &quot;noooo&quot; is bad but that scene is still good.</quote>

  <quote>The ending was a forced attempt at redemption, but the rest of the movie was a drama that played out like a thriller. Even though each act followed the same formula and it did lose a bit of its impact, it was still pretty gripping. At times I forgot I was watching a movie, especially when Woz and Jobs were going at it. Fassbender deserves nominations, everyone else also did a great job.</quote>

  <quote>Visually this movie is just stunning. As others have said, the magic realism is really amazing. But I just felt like the pacing was off and so my mind drifted off to other, non-movie related places, a few times. Still though, there are a lot of really memorable images in it and that's more than enough to recommend it. Aside from the cinematography, the acting and script is all good but not especially great.</quote>

  <quote>Only seen the Weerasethakul film in this. Thought it was wonderful. Nothing really happens, just some guys on a truck. But within those 4 minutes he manages to give good commentary on human rights, freedom of speech, etc, as the one guy cannot express himself (illegally there?) and the other can. Also; like his other films, he tries something neat... this time it's changing the lense in the middle of it. Always breaking convention and never forgetting that ultimately he's making a film.</quote>

  <quote>I don't find it to be this awe-inspiring, profound and deeply fascinating movie to the extent that some people do, but 80 still makes it a great movie in my eyes. It does do a decent job of dissecting truth in our everyday lives and documentaries, and the central story is entertaining (but honestly not THAT entertaining). However, it is an honest and sometimes awkward (in a good way) movie about a very personal issue. Drags a tad as well though.</quote>

  <quote>This movie does a pretty good job of talking about where newspaper comics started and where they have gone. Yes, it's a lot of talking heads talking about their love... but isn't that the point? It's not like they glorify everything. It's not real in-depth but it does the trick. Art is important to the people who make it. There's a weird video game part to explain financial aspects, but I dug it. Kick-ass game! That and the credits song tell me that the film makers had fun with the project.</quote>

  <quote>Like studie299 I didn't know why the black family was a part of this... until the end where it wrapped up in a way that was fairly vague. Perhaps I'm reaching, but I think that they used the black family and baseball to comment on racism being America's past time. It works for me so I'm going with it. I think it's a pretty clever movie, unpredictable, weird, good music, directed well. Militant satire, dark, sometimes silly.</quote>

  <quote>It accomplishes what it sets out to do in the hour that it has to do it. It gives you a run down on the beginning of his career, up until the end. I mean, the guy's a legend so giving another half hour or even an hour would have been nice but it was a TV movie, anyway. To those who aren't that familiar with Sugar Ray as a person (like me), it's informative. It also shows some video on choice beatdowns. You do get to see how perfect Ray was in the ring, in the videos shown.</quote>

  <quote>I think it's a common reaction for people to think these people are weird, and I feel the movie tackles this well. The main theme is what you'd expect (superheroes saving the world), but it does it in a good way, with a nice narrative. A lot of them have had some troubled past, and this is brought together with a theme of the time the woman was wronged and nobody helped her (I forget her name). They are scoffed by some, embraced by others. Either way they're trying and often do help.</quote>

  <quote>From the opening moment you feel the gravitas and it doesn't let up at all. Telling it without music was an interesting choice, letting the atmosphere and sounds around them tell more of the story. Thornton directed the hell out of this, every actor did a fantastic job. The death of the white guy was so deserved, fuck him. Sometimes it's slow to the point of tedium which doesn't allow me to give it over an 80, but the craftmanship is on point here and it has a predictable but important message.</quote>

  <quote>Maybe the best fart joke ever committed to film. There is so much dedication to it that it's almost a character of it's own. Yes, farts. An attempted suicide leads to a dead body leads to a fart. Oh yeah, there's a movie here too. In all seriousness, it has funny bits but wears a little thin in both the comedy and drama--during the middle portion--but the ending brings it back around impressively. It's a good, but not outstanding, indie flick underneath the weirdness but it's entertaining.</quote>

  <quote>It's not a horror movie that really succeeds in scaring the audience. There is a creepy atmosphere, which I like, and a few moments of terror, but if it wasn't as psychologically rich as it is then it would be a failure in the genre. What it does well is actually be a drama with some heart, so I was actually invested in the events and characters. It's dark and moody, but there's emotion.

  <quote>Dern playing this role a little differently than I expected (not just emoting extensively all over) was welcome. It's hard to criticize the story itself since Fox is telling her own story so directly instead of using her experience as just a framework to work on, but it wasn't told as well as it could have been. The choice to add the documentary aspects made it feel hokey at times. There are still great, powerful scenes within, but it did create a disconnect. But it is incredibly honest.</quote>

  <quote>Only knew the basic premise of this. When it all came together quickly at the beginning I wasn't sure how they would make it compelling for the rest of the runtime. However, it is one of those documentaries that unfolds a bit like a thriller (though it has been done better), with a real shocker. Said shocker then leads to some heavier explorations. It is a great doc even if it has pacing issues and can be a little unfocused. But you come mostly for the subject matter and in that regard, success.</quote>

I liked the music a lot, the acting was solid, the girl who shows her boobs really is beautiful and soft sci-fi works well, avoiding an explanation of time travel and just embracing the plot created by it.</quote>

The premise is cool too... an augmented reality where people get robot parts in order to live forever, thus making us no longer natural or organic.

  <quote>A return to form for Reitman, an excellent script from Cody, who kept it a little more subtle than her other stuff that I'm familiar with. But regardless of how good both of those people are at their jobs here, this movie is nothing without the performance of Theron, who plays a struggling mother to perfection. This was a tender, realistic, sweet, somewhat challenging portrayal of motherhood. I didn't really expect to like this as much as I did.</quote>

  <quote>In relation to Get Out it has higher highs and lower lows but is shot more interestingly in general. Peele came to play: lingering more, better shot composition, more inspired looking scenes. The underground/final fight specifically were very cool, very memorable. But the acting was hit and miss, some of the choices made on how to deliver lines were silly and threatened to take me out of the flick. Same with some of the scenes.

  <summary>A concise look at some of the more bizarre visual aspects of The Shining.

As much as any film he ever made, The Shining illustrates Kubrick's talent for using the language of pure cinema to tell his stories. (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>It isn't as good as The Guard or Calvary, but McDonagh has a formula that works. The dialogue is great, but I don't think the humour hits as hard as it should, and it's not as snappy as previous efforts, except for some parts. However, Terry and Bob are characters that are impossible to like until a transformation comes where I ended up giving a shit about them. Ultimately, it just isn't as polished and the writing isn't as good as the movies mentioned above, but this is still a lot of fun.</quote>

It's cool in a movie because there is tons of MMA to watch elsewhere. It succeeds admirably in being, I think, the first legit good MMA movie, but the MMA movie genre still has some ways to go to reach the levels of boxing. So watch it if you don't mind a ton of cliches that have been done before, and you're wondering if there are actual good MMA movies.</quote>

It does come across sometimes like he's just making characters to mock them, and I would never say there's any real drama here, but it's an entertaining watch with occasional brilliant moments and good, understated cinematography.</quote>

I mean, we can make werewolves look better now but this was '41 so it's pretty impressive.

  <quote>I rarely ever really care about the familes/victims in home invasion movies but surprisingly at some point I really started to cheer for Vinson's character-- what a badass, each kill became really triumphant. Outside of Vinson the acting ranges from bad to kinda decent, but luckily it didn't sink the flick.  Cool kills, interesting musical choices, goes in some fun directions. It's incredibly tense but not real scary, although a few jump scares exist.</quote>

I mean, despite the obvious allegories that that implies, it's just an interesting thing for alien invasion movies in general. I think they could have gone into more depth with the characters but regardless, it's a good movie.</quote>

  <quote>The first 10 minutes is incredible, but the ending was a lil wonky (though the very very end with the news was good). I enjoy the meta moments of it. It's pretty predictable and ultimately not real scary, but I actually like the motives of the killer. Some people say it makes no sense but really? The amount of people getting famous for nothing or for vlogs or whatever, and the amount of kids who want that, and you don't think the satire is on point? Not quite GREAT, but very good.</quote>

  <quote>I don't think it quite hits the &quot;great&quot; mark for me. I think it's a bold directorial debut, taking the subject of a sex (more specifically porn) addict guido and making a rom-com out of it. Everyone does well, and the lead characters are interesting enough. It was funny at times, but my issue is that it doesn't reach far beyond &quot;interesting enough&quot; or &quot;good enough.&quot; It's not hilarious but has a few great gags, the drama is good but not OVERLY memorable. But props for tackling porn head on.</quote>

  <summary>A lonely middle-aged catering manager (Bob Hoskins) spends all of his time studying tapes of an eccentric TV chef (Arsinee Khanjian). Meanwhile, a young woman (Elaine Cassidy) is making her way from Ireland to find her boy friend (Peter McDonald), who moved to England to get a job in a lawn-mower factory. On arrival, she makes an early contact with the caterer, who recommends a boarding room to her. Slowly, it is revealed that the caterer has in fact befriended and subsequently abused more than a dozen young women. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Even though I enjoyed Hoskins and Cassidy, the music and some of the character building, I felt it was paced way way too slowly which put me off a bit. I won't deny that it builds a pretty interesting profile of a serial killer and the ending isn't what you'd expect. He really does show off how disturbed this guy is, while making him completely human.</quote>

  <quote>The first half was very well done. It was creepy, oozed atmosphere, etc. The second half I still liked but not quite as much. I enjoyed that they took it in a different route (sort of) by going into The Further, and I liked that there was a story about astral projection because every other movie explains hauntings differently (and generically). Feeling a bit different than a lot of horrors, just like Saw 1 did, this movie rarely falls to stupid cheap scares, and uses its elements wisely.</quote>

Traversing treacherous back roads, lost highways, and isolated small towns, he unearths a multitude of bizarre and wickedly depraved slices of Americana. (Official promo)</summary>
  <quote>The Rambler is a really surreal movie. The Rambler himself is silent but goes through a shit ton of weird stuff. Does it make sense? Only Reeder really knows what it all means. But there are some wonderful (and usually grotesque) images in here, and the style of it is appealing. I was actually sort of connected to the Rambler due to his &quot;relationship&quot; with the girl who keeps dying. Sometimes music is used well, offering an interesting contrast between the weirdness and something more upbeat.</quote>

  <summary>In the early third century, the land of Wu is invaded by the warlord Cao Cao and his million soldiers. The ruler of Wu, Sun Quan, calls on the rival warlord Liu Bei for help, but their two armies are still badly outnumbered. However, the Wu strategist Zhou Yu sees that Cao Cao's army is unused to battling on the sea, which may just give them a chance if they can exploit this weakness properly. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I didn't get to see the full 4 hour one, I didn't know it existed until after I saw this but at 2 and a half hours it seemed fine. I think it dragged in some places actually, so adding more time probably wouldn't have helped that. But there were some great battle scenes even though a couple parts made me roll my eyes. Still... Dynasty Warriors. Could have used more (or any) Lu Bu.</quote>

  <quote>A nice look at rap. Sometimes they stuck the camera in some really weird places, but as a documentary on the art form it's good enough. Talks about what rap means to rappers, gets a good diverse look, because Ice-T talked to a lot of different rappers. Not every &quot;style&quot; is represented but it's a decent job.</quote>

  <quote>I wasn't as into what was going on as I could have been. Some parts, sure, but not always. However, this is one of those old horror movies that I feel are actually better due to the black and white, grainy film.  It just wouldn't be the same shot today in colour. It adds to the creepy atmosphere and due to the fact you spend time reading a book in the movie, it feels like a documentary of SORTS of someone discovering vampires. Plus the soundtrack is awesome and everything is shot well.</quote>

  <summary>Adam, a Jewish teenager and Yasmine, a young Lebanese girl, fall in love. Their relationship is overshadowed by the ongoing feud between their families, but also by the raging conflict in the Middle East. From the heart of Mile End, Montreal's multicultural neighborhood, comes this modern-day story of two lovers fighting against the walls that separate them. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The acting of the people involved can get a little wonky but generally it's decent enough, though never great. However, the girl who plays Yasmine manages to be really cute and vulnerable while the guy who plays Adam manages to be awkward and charming.  It focus on a relationship oppressed by different religions and does a good job showing that we are all people, no matter the religion or even political belief. I really liked the ending as well.</quote>

  <quote>How do I approach this? It's a mess, it's really calculated. It depends on whether you agree with &quot;a movie pretending to be bad is good&quot; or not. It definitely has tons to say and for that, good job Kelly, but a lot of people will be and have been turned off by this. From a narrative standpoint, it's a disaster, but maybe that's the point. Everytime I want to hate an aspect of it, I wonder if it's intentional. Frustrating, maybe great, maybe shit, but I'm giving it an 77 regardless. Might change.</quote>

  <quote>A completely solid telling of a classic graphic novel. It has pretty much everything you want from a Batman animated movie. It's dark, it's got fun action. The only problem is -- as Langelund said -- the uneven storytelling. I feel like it's way too much crammed in. If you could make this another hour longer then I imagine that'd be fixed, but I guess we'll never know.</quote>

  <summary>Having forged a 20-year run as one of the most innovative and influential hip hop bands of all time, the Queens NY collective known as 'A Tribe Called Quest' have kept a generation hungry for more of their groundbreaking music since their much publicized breakup in 1998. Michael Rapaport documents the inner workings and behind the scenes drama that follows the band to this day. He explores what's next for, what many claim, are the pioneers of alternative rap. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I was feelin' the documentary but don't feel like it went into as much detail as it could have. Good as a Tribe primer, of sorts, and  even though I'm white as snow (unless it's been pissed on...), I'm always fascinated with hip hop and hip hop culture, so I was interested. As someone else said, all it really has is some modern hip-hop artists to hype them up, but that's interesting and good enough. Could have been a 90 or so though.</quote>

  <summary>Three aliens travel to Earth in preparation for a mass invasion, taking possession of human bodies. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It can't quite hit &quot;great&quot; for me (an 80) because it meanders a little. I like the concept (ha) of aliens just taking pieces of our memories from us while we lose them forever. There were some great moments here but because of some fluff between them the pacing is sometimes off. Some of the music is spot on and the ending is genuine and touching.</quote>

  <quote>Strongest parts are when Kumail and Emily interact with one another, but watching him bond with her parents was nice too. Great chemistry between the leads, Kumail by himself is decent but hardly noteworthy. Kazan was lovely. As a comedy I don't think it necessarily succeeds though there are some giggles, but as a romance/drama flick it does. It's sad and heart-warming, authentic for obvious reasons. A little too long, slight pacing issues. I don't love it, but I enjoy it a fair bit.</quote>

  <quote>The obvious comparisons are A Quiet Place and The Happening, as others have said, but it's not as good as the first and much better than the latter. Bullock was really great here, I am digging these horror movies based on senses (or lack thereof I guess). The soundtrack is fantastic (Ross and Reznor do it again), the atmosphere is great. I guess just going down the river would be boring to watch if there was more but it suffers a little from too much backstory. Still very good.</quote>

  <quote>Love to African culture, but also blends it well with more North American tendencies (like Killmonger). The costumes are great, especially the BP suit itself, which might be the best in the MCU. Set design, the world it builds is great. Good performances. Humour falls flat mostly, finale is a little uninspired, not all action sequences work (but some do), made some of the cool trailer scenes a lot less cool. Has things to say but doesn't succeed as well at being an MCU movie; not as exciting.</quote>

It's an entertaining movie that does more justice to the premise than it probably deserves, and that's in part to the acting, the camera work, cinematography and excellent use of lighting/shadows (especially near the end). Yeah, it's a little silly but it never goes past the point that I couldn't buy into it. I don't love it, but acknowledge its importance and what was accomplished here.</quote>

  <quote>Undeniably gorgeous (a trait that his movies all share), but it's pretty demanding of the audience. Blissfully Yours was boring but this approached tedium, where it really stretched my limits as I waited for something to happen. He brought his A game right at the end but by then it was a little too late. With that said, the talent and filmmaking prowess that he possesses allowed this to be relatively entertaining, albeit incredibly slow.

And I'm okay with that! We had an excellent, more &quot;conventional&quot; Pooh in 2011 and this still maintained the spirit of Pooh anyway. It's inoffensive and sometimes funny, but ultimately it's driven by its themes more than its plot. Third act was a little bit lesser than the rest until the very end, needed more of the Pooh gang.</quote>

Also, near the end it gets really sad for a brief few minutes, and that got me; in part because Grant Rosenmeyer was incredibly believable as Scotty.

But I still dug it and was impacted by the emotion and the great performance by Trine Dyrholm.</quote>

  <quote>Outside of the importance of it from a mainstream Hollywood perspective it's still a good film in its own right. The stars are the set designs and costumes because they leaned so heavily into that and it paid off. Besides that it's a pretty basic romantic comedy in a lot of ways right until the end, but because it also leaned heavily into that it got me emotionally so I can't hate. The soundtrack's mixture of Chinese songs and cover versions of American songs plays into the themes nicely.</quote>

  <quote>It tackles its subject matter with some finesse, examining race relations with a fairly even approach. There are a bunch of different perspectives, which is nice, and through the good performances we got to see them fleshed out a fair bit. My knock on it, and what prevents it from being great, is that there are times that it's clearly attempting humour but can't usually get there. Good premise, and the execution as a drama was admirable, but it's not overly funny.</quote>

  <summary>It is 1939, the end of three years of bloody civil war in Spain, and General Franco's right-wing Nationalists are poised to defeat the left-wing Republican forces. A ten-year-old boy named Carlos (Fernando Tielve), the son of a fallen Republican war hero, is left by his tutor in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere. The orphanage is run by a curt but considerate headmistress named Carmen (Marisa Paredes) and a kindly Professor Casares, both of whom are sympathetic to the doomed Republican cause. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I certainly enjoyed it, but maybe seeing Pan's Labyrinth first spoiled me (since they share some similarities). With that said, it's still a wonderfully crafted movie, pretty touching with some nice visual touches, and good acting from pretty much all the children involved.</quote>

  <summary>A behind-the-scenes look at the making of Tommy Wiseau's The Room (2003). (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>James Franco is getting a lot of credit here, as he should, and everybody else is fine too. Maybe it's a victim of high expectations, but I was left feeling a little colder than I anticipated. It's still great; it's funny, entertaining the entire time, good musical choices, has a little bit of emotion. But ultimately it's a little light as others are saying, not really as impactful as some have lead me to believe.</quote>

  <summary>When Hollywood shuts him out, multi-talented Rudy Ray Moore strikes out on his own to make the blaxploitation film Dolemite (1975).</summary>
  <quote>As noted by joel-w-m, it's a little too breezy, so much so that it keeps it from being what I'd consider &quot;great.&quot; But that doesn't mean it's not a hell of a good time with a wonderful, inspired performance by Murphy, who is clearly in his element here. It's pretty funny as well.</quote>

  <quote>I got a very Lynchian feel in the way the world acts and the visuals. It was dark and wonderfully shot, the office being a character of its own. Eisenberg also does well pulling double duty as an awkward, hard worker and a suave winner who can lie his way through life. But something just left me kinda cold during it. I wasn't able to connect to the plot or characters like I would have liked. And I keep seeing that it was a dark comedy but I didn't laugh.</quote>

  <quote>Enjoyed the premise and how it built the tension (as others have said here), thought some of the dialogue was cool, but if I'm being honest I didn't love the action. The fight scenes were fine, but until the final one (which was better but still not amazing) I was left feeling very cold about the combat. Still an enjoyable wuxia flick, for sure, but it's been done better.</quote>

  <summary>A realistic road movie about a drug addict, his &amp;amp;#039;family&amp;amp;#039;, and their inevitable decline into crime. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Dillon's character was incredibly sympathetic. The film lost me briefly due to the pacing, but when it works it works admirably... and it works most of the time. Even though drug flicks don't resonate with me, from what I understand this is pretty realistic; it doesn't ham it up, go to any extremes. Some of the dialogue is exceptional, compelling stuff. Burroughs was a welcome addition even if the role was tiny. Good direction. Not absolutely in love with it but definitely worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>Weaker than The Lobster and Sacred Deer, probably because Lanthimos is at his best when it's really odd. This is pretty straightforward but still maintains some trademarks of his style: uses space incredibly well and makes rooms/hallways menacing and lonely, it's shot incredibly well as a whole and the music is great. The ending is also fantastic. There are bunnies. Great performances too. Dragged a little, didn't have a lot of oomph for the most part. Wait, this is a comedy? Not at all funny.</quote>

It's mysterious throughout the whole thing and builds tension really well, to the point where the movie actually really nails the paranoia of a superhero existing. The music is subtle but atmospheric and thoughtful. Even the way he flies sticks out, it's not as graceful and smooth as in some other movies/tv shows. It feels more realistic. I wish this was longer, but the way it ended was classy as well.</quote>

Part character study, part action movie, succeeds at both.</quote>

As his 'cast' come and go in front of his camera he directs them in a constant narration, telling them exactly what he wants them to do. As he moves his camera around he demands increasing control over his environment and obedience from his subjects - be they people, cars, trucks, birds, clocks or buildings! (imdb User Comments)</summary>
  <quote>I like it, I think it's interesting and original. There is actually a laugh or two, but it's mostly due to the fact that the director is trying to get birds to do what he wants, or clocks, etc. I saw people saying it's about if life imitates art or the other way around... also about the frustration of artists when things don't go exactly as they wish (uncontrollable happenings). So in this way, the short works, but be warned... it's 12 minutes of a guy telling people what to do.</quote>

  <summary>In a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the &quot;real&quot; world. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I liked it. I read the book but can't really remember it, so while some of it is a little cheesy (like the piano scene) and I felt the last act or so felt a little flat, I enjoyed watching the main character learn how to feel. It was pretty emotional and decently realized. Jeff Bridges was awesome.</quote>

  <summary>In GLOBAL METAL, directors Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn set out to discover how the West's most maligned musical genre - heavy metal - has impacted the world's cultures beyond Europe and North America. The film follows metal fan and anthropologist Sam Dunn on a whirlwind journey through Asia, South America and the Middle East as he explores the underbelly of the world's emerging extreme music scenes; from Indonesian death metal to Chinese black metal to Iranian thrash metal. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Better than his first but still doesn't reach the level of awesomeness this kind of subject deserves. It's interesting to see the different political climates and how metal comes into the picture. It could have gone a lot deeper with even another half hour but whatever, as it is, this is a good metal docu from someone who loves metal.</quote>

  <quote>It's obvious what the movie is directing its anger at.  If you're a cranky old man, and accept that this movie applies to everyone in some way (like either they hate you or you hate something they hate), then you'll have a great time. They tackle bigger issues about America and whatnot, but then they go after little things like obnoxious movie-goers. The first little while is amazing, and while it gets a little more conventional, it stays good. Excellent satire.</quote>

  <summary>Warlord Toyotumi Hideyoshi rises to power in the late 16th century after the assassination of his lord Oda Nobunaga. In these chaotic times, chivalrous bandit Goemon rises as a hero among commoners, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. In one of his many escapades, he steals a box from a merchant, and passes it off to a street urchin. But this turns out to be no ordinary box as warlord Toyotomi's right-hand man Ishida soon sends ninja and childhood friend Saizo after Goemon. (www.yesasia.com)</summary>
  <quote>Very stylish and visually interesting movie with characters who have ninja abilities that are, er, exaggerated a little bit to the point that they can jump in the air and perform video game-like awesomeness. Needless to say, a very good time.</quote>

  <quote>In general it doesn't bring anything fresh to familiar themes. Two people go on the road together, one is racist, the other has issues with their identity, but they bond and things change. I mean, it works because there's heart in the script and chemistry between the leads. However, I've been conditioned to think a character like Tony Lip will eventually be abusive to his family and yet this film doesn't resort to making him worse just for the sake of redemption. It's a nice little touch.</quote>

  <quote>You get these types of movies that try to be quirky and fail, but I didn't ever feel like this was forced. It is very offbeat, in a really good way. I thought the central romance was done well and was really cute. Maeve Dermody is adorable, and Ryan does a good job too. Sure, the meaning can be a little odd... like it's well meaning cuz I think too many people criticize people for being &quot;weird&quot; just cuz they're different. But don't pretend to fight crime, that's actually dangerous to yourself.</quote>

  <quote>Great soundtrack, and very very stylish. It's nice to see an action movie (though it's kind of light on action) shot in a pretty original way. It handles the innocence and assassin aspects well. I don't know why they thought the ending was a good idea (I mean the very last like, 5 minutes or something). The action scenes are well shot, though. I wouldn't say the plot itself is anything real special, and due to everything I've talked about... this movie is quite a bit different than I expected.</quote>

  <quote>Obviously video games and movies like Crank are the big reference points here, and that's true: HH is a bare-bones FPS with a thin story and little reason to care about the characters, yet, the action is mostly inventive with the gimmick working well most of the time. Occasionally it's really disorienting and stifles the flames of violence, and it feels a little long, but up until it becomes a bit of a drag around the third act, it's a hell of a lot of fun. Doesn't reach 'great' status though.</quote>

  <summary>In the future people stop aging at 25 and must work to buy themselves more time, but when a young man finds himself with more time than he can imagine he must run from the corrupt police force to save his life. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>While it doesn't do all it could with a very very cool premise, it's still really good. The acting isn't always great, but Cillian Murphy was a very nice pick. I was impressed with Timberlake in Alpha Dogs but he was only serviceable here, much like everyone else (most of the time). But ultimately it's a fun Bonnie &amp;amp; Clyde in a Dystopian Future movie, and it pretty much accomplishes it. I'm a sucker for Dystopias, period, so I enjoyed it. It's not nearly as bad as critics are saying. Fuck 'em.</quote>

  <quote>A great documentary about an interesting world. At times depressing, at times pretentious, it has moments of inspiration, moments of tension, and moments where you can start to understand what goes on. I love Braid but I don't like listening to Blow talk (most of the time). The film makers did a good job of picking developers who were quite different than one another, in order to get different views. Tommy was depressing as fuck.</quote>

  <quote>You can run the risk of things looking silly when you put an invisible man on screen terrorizing people. It fell victim to that a couple times but for the most part it was well done with a great sense of atmosphere and tension. Definitely more psychological thriller than horror movie, I appreciated that. It's not amazing in any way but it's also not bad in any substantial way. Haunting score, good performances, some nice twists and turns. Ended up enjoying it more than anticipated.</quote>

  <quote>It is certainly lesser but still very good. Still visually interesting, and the acting all around is still great with Skarsgard being the highlight. Got some good comedy and heart. The problems are: rehashes part 1 stuff and doesn't do it as well, throws the cosmic grenade in the room and doesn't explore it well, maybe too much comedy this time, and the pacing isn't as good. But I still enjoyed it quite a bit even if I didn't love it this time around.</quote>

Despite the best intentions of both families, paranoia and mistrust boil over as the horrors outside creep ever-closer, awakening something hidden and monstrous within him as he learns that the protection of his family comes at the cost of his soul. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The marketing is shit, as others have said this isn't really a horror movie. There are some scary parts, most notably in the dream sequences, but it's more of a drama. Which is fine, but it doesn't go anywhere that interesting. The ending is intense and there's a tension throughout that is endearing, good atmosphere, good acting, shot well, but after the excellent beginning I thought there would be more. Final shot is great though. It's just a flick that competently does something familiar.</quote>

  <quote>It's another down and out boxer story. McCabe is an alcoholic boxer who lost his mom and with his best days behind him he goes to an unlicensed boxing match to get some money. Having a soft spot for the boxing genre I am generally into these and this is no different. It's depressing and Johnny Harris gives a good performance as McCabe. Some moments are truly heartbreaking and there's a sincerity here (Harris wrote it and based it off his life) that makes it more compelling. Worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>A bit of a return for Smith. I like seeing these characters and I imagine I always will, and that counts for basically everything here since it's just self-referential. But that's all it was supposed to be and it succeeds. Some of the humour doesn't hit and makes me wonder if I've outgrown Smith, but then he would come back with a great joke, proving that no, I have not. It differs from Strike Back because this one had more emotional depth, but at the expense of better jokes as a whole.</quote>

Despite help from other demon hunters, the hog gets away.</summary>

Plus, this is a classic tale of a struggling artist who goes on and accomplishes her dreams while having some personal problems; this stuff usually draws a person in.

  <summary>The story takes place in a country about which we know nothing: a country of snow and dense forests. A family lives isolated near a lake. Alexi, the brother, is a young man with pure heart. A woodcutter. An ecstatic, prey to epileptic fits, he is open to the nature around him. Alexi is terribly close to his younger sister, Hege. Their blind mother, their father and their little brother are the silent witnesses to their overwhelming love. A stranger arrives, a young man barely older that Alexi. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's not easy to follow, even though not a lot happens. You spend an hour and a half and nothing really happens. However, there is some nice imagery and it shows the isolation really well. The beginning is very affective, and so is the end. The stuff in between isn't always easy to sit through, and the narrative is almost non-existent. There's a lot of darkness. The image isn't always clear. I liked it, I thought it was artistic. But for those reasons, maybe it won't be your cup of tea.</quote>

Don't get it twisted, it still is basically them saying how great he is, but there is some balance here calling him a liar and a dick, basically. Good watch.</quote>

  <summary>When two people &quot;connect&quot; the bond between them can be so pure and simple as to stir hearts in heaven. When they connect in all the right places at all the wrong times, heaven weeps for broken hearts. To heal these broken hearts, heaven breaks time. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A bit of a surprise for me. I ended up getting into this. The plot is wonky at times (dealing with time travel usually is), but it was convincing enough that I was able to get past that. Even two actors that I don't usually like were pretty good. It's a good romance flick.</quote>

  <quote>The casting is perfect. The casting of Takei as an Economics teacher is like Bergman and Bogie in Casablanca... you could have the movie without it but it'd lose its charm. Not that this movie is Casablanca, I just like the comparison. -pats self- Anyway, Steve was really funny and while it did go a lil bit without laughs here and there, there were some huge laughs. Not bland, the setting may be (guy works at Umart and then takes economics n'shit... that's the point), but the movie is not.</quote>

The script has a few fun twists, but yes it can be predictable and they spend time awkwardly explaining why magic works; I'm okay with that though because it does feel like there's some mythology here. Most importantly, it's just entertaining.</quote>

The social commentary is there through the whole thing but the way it ties Capitalism and lack of individuality into a child's creativity and an adults obsession with just &quot;constructing&quot; lego is nothing short of amazing.</quote>

  <quote>I this was probably about a 70 until the haunting ending, which I adore. It's a slow-paced drama where very little actually happens, but there are still great moments because of the play between Clover (Kendrick) and her dad (Troughton). They have trouble communicating, but they say a lot through other means; there's a lot of shit boiling under the service. I think both of them deserve credit for powerful performances because they're easily the best part.</quote>

(magpictures.com)</summary>
  <quote>A compelling documentary about a man who did a lot for criticism. It does a good job of painting Roger as an actual human being, with his pros and cons, and I always choke up when they talk about his relationship with Siskel. R.I.P. Roger.</quote>

Great direction, wonderful performances, technically amazing. Eggers' director prowess is something to be seen, but the writing needs work. It's really not scary at all and I wasn't as interested in the interactions between the two as I thought I would be. First act could be better as well.</quote>

  <summary>Matthew McConaughey stars in the big-screen adaptation of Michael Connelly's best-selling novel about struggling lawyer Mickey Haller, who conducts business from his Lincoln Town Car. When Mickey finally lands a big case, it has deadly consequences. Tasked with defending rich lothario Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), who's been charged with assault, Mickey finds himself and his family in danger when he deduces that the sinister Louis may be guilty.</summary>
  <quote>It succeeds on everything it needs to, but doesn't offer anything original to the formula. Who's complaining though? This is a great flick. It has a well written script, and a great performance by McConaughey, who isn't really known for giving great performances. He's charming and, well, was born to play this role. This translates to a thrilling courtroom drama with enough twists and turns to interest anybody.</quote>

  <quote>It's an easily digestible film about a gay guy coming out and the consequences of such... and I'd be lying if I said that it didn't get me emotionally. Sometimes it gets a little overblown, but it does do a good job of riffing on that for the most part. For example, the ending is too much and yet it didn't lose me because I was cheering for Simon and they made a joke about it. But damn, apologize to your little sis who was just trying to help! 75 for now, might up it 5 points later.</quote>

  <quote>Nichols is incredible, and the performances by Edgerton and Negga are unstated by effective. In fact, the entire movie refuses to go huge; too often, these types of films do that but here the intimacy and love of the marriage shines through. There are moments where it's a little boring, and that keeps it from reaching higher heights. Now, this is Nichols' worst film so far but I still rate it an 80 because while I quite enjoyed it, I'm not LOVING it. Also, way to sneak Shannon in there again.</quote>

It does a good job of keeping you guessing whether her friends are good or bad, the ending was kind of meh, but the performances were good, especially by Juno Temple.

  <summary>A highly styled 'genre' film which can perhaps be seen as a pastiche of all gangster movies. Tom Reagan is the laconic anti-hero of this amoral tale which is also, paradoxically, a look at morals within the criminal underworld of the 1930s. Two rival gangs vie for control of a city where the police are pawns, and the periodic busts of illicit drinking establishments are no more than a way for one gang to get back at the other. Black humour and shocking violence compete for screen time as we question whether or not Tom, right-hand man of the Irish mob leader, really has a heart. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The only thing that I can see wrong with Miller's Crossing is that there's a cold detachment that makes it hard to really care. I think that's present in a bunch of their movies, and that's why my opinion is sometimes middling with their movies. But this is interesting enough, with some great dialogue, and some beautifully shot scenes. Definitely worth a watch, but not especially brilliant by any means.</quote>

  <quote>There's definitely heart here and as usual Moretz does a good job embodying the character. It's enjoyable the entire time but there wasn't a moment, a character, a scene, dialogue or anything that really stuck out and elevated it beyond being merely a very good movie. Which is by no means a bad thing, but in the ever growing coming-of-age genre it doesn't bring a lot to the table and could have done more with its premise.</quote>

  <quote>Obviously there's an agenda here but I don't mind that because artists are allowed to have their own agendas. So if you take away the fact that yes, it is preachy, it's a pretty thrilling ride. Has some comedy that mostly works, some great performances from Clooney, Roberts and my boy O'Connell, and it actually made me feel emotions in my cold heart. Also, that scene with O'Connell's gf that you see in the trailer is much cooler in the movie. Fun, not great... but definitely entertaining.</quote>

  <quote>Should have spent more time on the Mothman and less time on the personal relationships and the prophecies. I like emotional connection but it's pretty obvious the Mothman is the most interesting character in the myth/conspiracy/story/truth/whatever you want to call it. Still, it was a solid movie with a few really inspired parts. I enjoyed the direction, as the camera just sort of floated about most of the time.</quote>

  <quote>They draw it out a little bit, but this is one of those movies that is definitely worth a single watch. Repeated viewings won't encourage a change of opinion, since so much of it is focused on the murder mystery. It has a great ensemble cast and all that, and they do a good job, but Finney is easily the best. It's solid, but was unable to keep me on the edge of my seat, like some of the great films in this genre have.</quote>

There's an odd uneasiness that permeates throughout, until it goes disgusting at the end, proving that Refn does have a talent for both style and violence/gore. Awesome title, as well.</quote>

  <quote>The story within a story was the best part, easily, giving us an emotional revenge tale where Shannon and Gyllenhaal give great performances. The problem is that the real world parts with Adams are... okay. Adams does what she can to try to save the material but it is just a lot of her dropping books and moping. You never really get into her. But regardless, it's also we beautifully shot film with a subtly crushing ending, despite the lack of interest in Adams' character. Still a success.</quote>

I felt like the movie was trying to be more meaningful than it really was, but with that said, watching Joe's sex-filled life unfold is still reasonably interesting, helped in part by Martin being able to both play a bitch and somehow be sympathetic. Shia does a good job as well.</quote>

Stewart gives a great performance (obligatory tits x2 shoutout because male), and I enjoy the pacing.

  <summary>In the near future, instant DNA identification has created an information grid that makes crime extremely difficult, and anonymity impossible. But, suddenly, the same ID's start to appear in different locations. A pro-level and intelligent Sci- Fi piece about the genesis of a Big Brother State. (Shortoftheweek.com)</summary>
  <quote>Some of the acting is a tad sub-par, but for the most part I like it. Time travel and dystopias, good enough for me. The world that plurality builds is pretty much purposely characterless (thus actually giving it character in context) and it does well. Good visual design. The cliff hanger ending wasn't totally unexpected but it excites me to see what's going to happen.</quote>

  <summary>A dramatization of the Montreal Massacre of 1989 where several female students were murdered by an unstable misogynist.</summary>
  <quote>Despite being almost 10 years old this is really relevant today. I had to remind myself it was made in 2009 and not now. The black and white adds to it, along with the minimalist music, showcasing the work of a director who would go on to make some of the most interesting directorial efforts of modern times. But he shows enough artistic restraint to not make this too beautiful because I mean, it is a movie about a massacre and you don't want to lose that. Nice balancing act.</quote>

  <quote>I grew up with the PR like many children, but I didn't crave anymore PR in my life. The show is actually awful, but as a kid that didn't matter. They did what they had to do here; made it a little darker but with some humour. I actually cared, it was good enough that it isn't just nostalgia fueling it, but I did mark out when &quot;go go Power Rangers&quot; started. I'm surprised how much I enjoyed it. They need to up the coolness of the fighting though if there's a sequel. Weirdly, I'm in.</quote>

The second half left me guessing because I had never read the short story that it is based on. As always, with time travel movies, there is only so much logic you can apply here, and inevitably people will rip holes in it, but it was thrilling. Snook was wonderful in this as well.</quote>

  <quote>While the events don't develop in a way that will shock anybody, this is a more personal look at time travel. The &quot;found footage&quot; way in which it was filmed actually heightens the intimacy of it, and it is more focused on the relationships of the teens than anything else. It doesn't have any breakout stars, and could shorten certain scenes, but it's solid film making. In my eyes, judging from the way it has been received so far, it will go down as an underrated movie.</quote>

  <quote>I hope there's a part 2. I'm assuming the budget was small, so the special effects were done well. I was hesitant to watch cuz I saw &quot;nazi zombies&quot; and they're overdone but there's more to this than just that. The acting was fine, the Sci-Fi elements were implemented well, and the movie maintained a sense of intrigue throughout the 15 or so mins. The battle in the field left a little to be desired, but all-in-all, the grainy, muted colors add a great sense of atmosphere to this Sci-Fi</quote>

  <quote>The first bit of it really captured a sense of awe, the plot moved wonderfully and the visuals helped. Had it continued like this it would be in the 90s. As the movie went on it got more predictable, but still had amazing visuals, and great horror. It lost some of its sense of wonder as it went on, but it was still entertaining. The conclusion wasn't as satisfactory as it could be, but it felt like a real sci-fi movie, not a wannabe, so props to Scott and crew.</quote>

  <quote>Suffered from some of the things that plagued Miami Vice, though not to that extreme (I'm talking of some awkward edits). The DV mostly works but there are a couple shots where it sticks out like a sore thumb.

Some scenes, like the chase in the forest have amazing cinematography.</quote>

  <quote>It's one of the strangest looks at puberty I think. I'm not entirely sure if the idea of puberty scaring him and adults being hideous monsters really connect like the creator of the short wanted because puberty doesn't make an adult (it's part of it though, obviously). Could have just chosen the adult fear. BUT I still really enjoyed this short because of the imagery. It was disturbing, original, the animation was great, it was actually pretty scary over the short period of time it existed.</quote>

  <quote>I feel like it mostly makes you  have sympathy for the rich people. I think Jackie in particular is the most interesting. David really gets no sympathy from me. I don't know if that's the movie's fault or just my own personal values. Aside from that, it does a good job of depicting a riches to rags (as David said) type of story. Lauren tried but with these kinds of subjects, it's hard to ignore the class hatred or envy (whatever you feel) and truly care. Valiant effort though.</quote>

  <quote>There is no doubt the talent involved here. Inarritu shoots this entire thing well, with expert cinematography and a moody soundtrack. DiCaprio gives a great performance but so does Hardy and everybody else. It's suffering pretty much from moment one, but it lacks a little bit of soul. It's 2 and a half hours and feels a bit long, and like kevinjoseph, it didn't have as much impact on me as it should have. It's hard to hate on anything from a technical standpoint. Respected more than liked.</quote>

  <summary>A ritual is an action distinguished from all others in that it seeks realization of its purpose through the exercise of form. In this sense ritual is art; and even historically, all art derives from ritual. In ritual the form is the meaning. More speci fically, the quality of movement itself is not a merely decorative factor; it is the meaning itself of the movement. In this sense, this film is a dance. (Picpal.com)</summary>

  <quote>That was both excellent and a great reason why I love short films; you're able to explore smaller ideas that only work as contained pieces. This would suck if it was expanded into a bigger movie, but as a 5 minute experiment, it's a nifty mind bender with a dark and fantastic ending that I didn't see coming. What a prick! So much evil within 5 minutes.</quote>

Wandering among the ruins of the lifeless city, Rosa will soon discover that she is not the only part of Kernel that has awakened. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Will be interesting to see the feature film of this, even though it'll be live-action. This does what it sets out to do: a sci-fi backdrop (which is gorgeous) and some action. Though the Kung Fu aspects of it aren't the greatest, it's still pretty thrilling for the entire 9 minutes. But my god, the imagery is nice.</quote>

  <quote>Harris adds a lot of depth to his villain role because he's great, and the relationship between him and Neeson actually adds some emotional depth. Outside of that, yeah, it's kinda predictable and the pacing is off occasionally... but it's one of the better action films Neeson has done, even if it only strays from the formula a little bit -- most notably in the aforementioned relationship between him and Harris.</quote>

  <quote>In the minority I guess but I really liked this. It had its flaws but for the most part were minor. I liked the characters, I liked the atmosphere. I also liked the masks (I know that's pretty shallow but fuck it, reminded me of Army of Two). I liked some of the conventions it broke. I'm iffy at this point on the ending. I thought the violence was actually horrific (in a good way). I don't really see why people don't like it. Because it's &quot;heavy handed?&quot; I thought it was well made.</quote>

It's obvious that Sollima was trying to hit the same beats as Denis in the original, but it rarely had that same level of dread.

I won't ruin anything because if you haven't seen it, the twists and turns are what make the second half interesting. Plus Mara is lovely.</quote>

  <quote>I can't quite hit this up to an 80 because while I think it's very good, it doesn't have that thing or two that puts it beyond that. It's one of those slice of life flicks where very little happens, so it relies on the chemistry of the actors to get it done for the most part. And it succeeds but doesn't excel. It is shot well and the hypnotic OST from Aska Matsumiya lent beauty and gravitas to it when it was applied, specifically at the end, which was almost enough to grant it an 80.</quote>

  <quote>While I appreciate the militant satire, admittedly the first little while is not that compelling, which hurts the film as a whole. It does kick it up several notches (that's an understatement) as it goes on and gets amazingly weird, and that's where it's at its best. But when it was striving for more comedic beats it didn't always hit. Still, this is ambitious and Boots is in the running for best director of the year because of how he juggled all the disparate elements.</quote>

  <summary>Based on the true childhood experiences of Noah Baumbach and his brother, The Squid and the Whale tells the touching story of two young boys dealing with their parents divorce in Brooklyn in the 1980's. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Gotta give lots of lovothe to the script, first and foremost. It is so totally honest it's heart breaking. The acting is all around great. It isn't brought down by typical indie bullshit; you might think it will be (I avoided renting it for a long time because of this) but ultimately it goes above and beyond that.</quote>

  <summary>Martin was a normal teenage boy before the country collapsed in an empty pit of economic and political disaster. A vampire epidemic has swept across what is left of the nation's abandoned towns and cities, and it's up to Mister, a death dealing, rogue vampire hunter, to get Martin safely north to Canada, the continent's New Eden.</summary>
  <quote>There are little scenes here and there that I felt were a little  silly, but then there were really awesome scenes too. More awesome than silly, all-in-all. The rest of the movie was good too, with a good atmosphere, and a plot that may just be people wandering around trying to survive, but I enjoy that. It is like The Road in that sense, and I feel it's stronger for it. You have a badass character teaching a younger guy, who comes into his own, and the ending was well done.</quote>

  <quote>Not all of the pieces fit together well but I think there's an excitement to how unabashed it is about what it is trying to accomplish. It helps that it's shot beautiful with some great imagery, an excellent usage of its monsters (knowing that it shouldn't show them all the time). A good performance by the lead. Some of the musical choices hurt the tone, and when its more conventional aspects creep in it's less inspired. But at the very least it's pretty unique.</quote>

  <quote>When I first heard of it, I thought it'd be a throwaway movie, but I was surprised. It's bolstered by a wonderful but not overstated performance by Jack O'Connell. It doesn't hit the highs of something like Hunger or R, where there were scene after scene of brilliance (especially in Hunger), and I didn't leave it with a feeling of awe but there aren't any real flaws here. Believable criminals, an honest look at jail and rehabilitation. It's just a more-than-solid prison drama.</quote>

  <quote>Visually fantastic, really stylish. Great action set piece at the end. Quite a funny, quirky movie as well. Then that's where I get really confused... was the choice to have them speaking in broken english intentional or was it just poor as shit acting? Either way, it's still an amazing movie, but once I figure that out, I might like it more than I do now, because it'd add the extra dimension to it. Somebody help me and I'll give you a gun and some gold.</quote>

  <quote>It doesn't really go out of its way to do anything new from a narrative perspective, but it's all executed good enough that it's much better than mediocre. I chalk this up to the way it's shot; the town looks menacing and not quite right, whether it's the shit that goes on around the main characters (which is never returned to), or the emphasis the director/cinematographer put on the environment. Trees seem evil here (which they are, fuck trees and their ulterior motives).</quote>

  <summary>A coming-of-age story that follows 12-year-old Andy Nichol (Chase Ellison), a bright student who, like most kids his age, will do anything to avoid conflict for fear of suffering overwhelming ridicule and punishment from his junior high school peers. Everyone's favorite teacher, Mr. Simon (Ed Harris), pairs Andy with the school's biggest outcast and social pariah, Stanley, aka &amp;amp;quot;Big G&amp;amp;quot; (Alexander Walters) on a critical term project. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It does a good job of doing what coming-of-age stories are meant to do. I like that even though Stanley isn't the main character, the movie kind of revolves around him, in a sense. I thought it was an emotional movie, tackling the irrational fear of homosexuality, the importance of teachers, and of course, kids growing up. I didn't find it overly funny so it's more of a drama to me than a comedy. I guess since it's classified as a comedy, that's a bit of a fail, but fuck it.</quote>

The first little while wasn't great but once Loki got unleashed the entire movie just got better, partially because of him but partially because I just felt everything else got more entertaining and amusing. There's some decent action here, decent acting, decent everything. It's just another comic book movie but those are okay once in a while. I'm not a big Thor fan though.</quote>

  <quote>It has an oppressive atmosphere and both leads do well with what they are given. The direction is great: a Hitchcockian sense of tension and suspense, solid usage of lighting and sound (seriously cool soundtrack) to build the mood. It even made me laugh a few times. And yet despite all the fantastic elements I did not love it. Technically efficient in all regards except its inability to make me care for them. At first I thought it was an interesting relationship but it lost me a bit.</quote>

It's usually beautiful, reminds me a tiny bit of a less challenging, avant-garde and provocative Gummo (my fave movie) and due to the way its filmed, it looks a little retro and the grainy visuals make it seem like a documentary.</quote>

  <quote>At first I wasn't feelin' it, but as it went on it sucked me into its plot. I don't feel like it was the most tightly written movie I've ever seen by any means but it's well put together with good performances. By the end of it all, it has mind fucked you a bit, but not overly so.</quote>

  <summary>Five years ago David's life came undone when his young daughter fell victim to a brutal attack. The subsequent emotional fallout cost him his marriage and his job. Handicapped by guilt and anguish David abandoned his past and alienated himself. He took a second rate job as a security guard and plodded on - his wounds concealed but unhealed. All it would take is a scratch for them to open wide and consume him... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A nice revenge flick, nothing more, nothing less. What you will get is a guy having a reason to get back at people... and he goes out and does it. It's not real violent until the end, so most of the movie is a build-up. I'm a big fan of the ending though, instead of a happy ending the movie shows just how useless his attempts were.</quote>

  <quote>There are amazing scenes in here. But then the rest of the movie is kind of okay, nothing terribly special. Not quite boring, but not real interesting. When he embraced the surrealism I was more intrigued because the movie didn't hit me on an emotional level. For a movie that tries to be so beautiful (and it succeeds at times, most definitely), I didn't get that feeling of a masterpiece. I did for the first half hour or so though. This was on its way to a 90.</quote>

I'm a big fan of her music, but I haven't been as much of a fan of her videos because I think a bunch of them have just ended up being silly instead of artsy. But this was a nice balance, a little trippy, and even a little emotional. It was dreamy but gritty at times and the acting was believable (especially considering the director says that they didn't know about the robbery).</quote>

  <quote>Possibly an 85. There are some really dull moments, but for the most part it's a pretty terrifying and suspenseful flick. The soundtrack is the biggest reason why, as it is just straight up creepy. The imagery is interesting and Johannson does give a good performance as an alien who apparently is figuring out what it's like to be human. I think. It's a cold but mostly affective movie.</quote>

  <summary>Until the Light Takes Us is a feature length documentary chronicling the history, ideology and aesthetic of Norwegian black metal - a musical subculture infamous as much for a series of murders and church arsons as it is for its unique musical and visual aesthetics.</summary>
  <quote>I disagree with people who say there's no point. From it, one can learn that there's an opposing voice in Norway that gets misunderstood, media twists shit the way they want, and one can learn things about black metal they might not have known. It has a good mixture of ambient music and black metal. It's not perfect by any means, but it has a certain aesthetic, a visual and emotional sense, that is true to the scene and is just interesting on its own. Pretty good for a pointless film.</quote>

Soon the daylight begins to disappear completely, and as the survivors gather in an abandoned tavern, they realize the darkness is out to get them, and only their rapidly diminishing light sources can keep them safe.</summary>
  <quote>I'm just not behind the hate on this one. First of all, the movie plays perfectly on a very common fear of the dark, and makes a creepy thriller with only two big jump scares, which are made more amazing due to the fact there aren't 80 of them. I think, even though most of the movie is pretty dark, that there are actually some good images (like when the shadow people show up, for example). I also like that nothing is explained. I like just watching people survive. The acting was serviceable.</quote>

It's a compelling murder mystery with Bell delivering clever and witty retorts to just about everyone... just like the TV show. Maybe it doesn't feel as big as a movie should, but it's a damn good episode, if nothing else. It's not a movie for people unfamiliar with the show, but that should be obvious.</quote>

  <quote>The intimacy and rawness of the way it was shot made it feel a bit like a documentary. There's a plot there, technically, but it's more slice of life than conventional story. It takes a little while to get going and still occasionally lost my interest. But the parts that are good are really good, and it elevates itself in the last half hour or so. You have to enjoy watching the characters interact and it did feel organic and genuine. Intercutting with drawings periodically was a nice touch.</quote>

Even if the Brown death was a mess, this still brings up valid issues.</quote>

Has something to say and while I think that sometimes gets lost, it does stick to its themes well. I don't think it's substantial because a better director would bring the writing to life more (like in Sicario), but it's a good directorial debut for sure with a great sense for atmosphere and understanding of the Western.</quote>

The dialogue is hard to understand at times, but there was a lot of research here. My issue is that for as creepy as it is--not allowing us to feel any sanctuary from the tone--it doesn't have enough moments in it that impacted me. There were a couple, but I wasn't terrified (and I thought I would be). Works more as a drama than a horror.</quote>

It's a positive message that has some drama but doesn't lose focus on its message of kindness... movies like this need to exist. There are some hokey parts--the flashback with grandma is astonishingly bad--but the movie is effective with good performances and a little more depth than one might expect since it digs a little deeper into the lives these people.</quote>

  <quote>I actually liked it a bit more than Brazil, and I know that's strange. It might have been my mood when I watched Brazil, but that was so long ago I don't remember. But I love the visuals on display here, and I actually cared a little bit about the main character. The weirdness was appealing, and I generally had a good time watching this man stuck in a world overrun by technology and a job that looks like Minecraft. It's not real deep, but it's good enough to be worth thinking about.</quote>

  <quote>I don't expect a non-documentaryto hit all the factual beats, so some fictionalized ones are okay. I don't know much about this story but from the little I've now read there are some things I wish could have been in here. The jump to Jan fighting the Nazis was really jarring and it's upsetting that they didn't build to that at all, but this is an emotional movie with good performances. Nice to see original WW2 tales in movies. Also, Antonina has my views on humans vs animals. Fuck humans.</quote>

This has a less inspired beginning, with a bunch of exposition, but that gets cooler and more interesting as it goes on. It's a rather simple short, just trying to escape from one place to another, doesn't end that satisfyingly (like them all) but creature who is stitched together from 96 of its other victims and retains their memories... that shit is horrifying with a great scream.</quote>

  <summary>Born with a gift he didn&amp;amp;#039;t want, the ability to clearly recognize the half-breed angels and demons that walk the earth in human skin, Constantine (Reeves) was driven to take his own life to escape the tormenting clarity of his vision. But he failed. Resuscitated against his will, he found himself cast back into the land of the living. Now, marked as an attempted suicide with a temporary lease on life, he patrols the earthly border between heaven and hell, hoping in vain to earn his way to salvation by sending the devil&amp;amp;#039;s foot soldiers back to the depths.  (Warner Bros.)</summary>
  <quote>Even though it basically shits all over the comic book, it's a moody thriller that makes you want to smoke. I'm kidding about the smoking thing... sort of. Keanu Reeves gives a decent enough performance and the action is pretty entertaining as well. It's not even close to being a great movie but if you want a religious theme thriller with demon killing, and don't want to have to think, here's a decent enough one.</quote>

  <quote>Liked it but didn't love it. The psychological elements of it are interesting enough, how Nikita loses her individuality because of a coersive government. I think the blue tint works well enough, but there were some quirky parts I didn't care for that made it all seem just... really silly and it didn't really seem like the right movie for that. The action, when it happens, is pretty good too. Jean Reno = Awesome.</quote>

Good direction in pretty much every way and incredible music (I like how it's pretty much one song). But I couldn't get engaged, it just kind of plods along.</quote>

  <quote>It does feel like The Informant in some ways, like someone else said but I liked this a lot more. Maybe it's because I understood the jokes more, and I understood what they were talking about more often. I love the cast here and without them this would be worse. The problem is that it goes for pretty long stretches without a laugh (but has some great ones) and this movie isn't the most emotional thing ever so you're left with a few too many parts where you feel nothing. Still, a good flick.</quote>

  <summary>Frank W. Abagnale (DiCaprio) worked as a doctor, a lawyer and as a co-pilot for a major airline -- all before his 21st birthday.  A master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill at check fraud had netted him millions of dollars in stolen funds.  FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) has made it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank is always one step ahead of him, baiting him to continue the chase. (DreamWorks)</summary>

Fueled by a suitcase full of mind-bending pharmaceuticals, Duke and Gonzo set off on a fast and furious ride through nonstop neon, surreal surroundings and a crew of the craziest characters ever.</summary>

As the first wave of refugees return, a family is reunited, but one of them unwittingly carries a terrible secret. The virus is not yet dead, and this time, it is more dangerous than ever.

  <quote>Unflinching in its delivery to the point that it's uncomfortable. You don't necessarily like these people, even Abbi Jacobson's character who means well but makes odd decisions; for that reason some people will hate this because a lot of people need a hero to cheer for. It's not even entertaining really, at least not in a conventional sense, but it's interesting because of how much it commits to its devastation. Not the greatest drug movie of all-time by any means but definitely worth a watch.</quote>

I mean, she is, but it isn't her only reason for doing it, and porn isn't treated like the devil in this movie. Good performance by her, rest of the movie was good, but deserved a better ending.

I went in for cool action scenes and I enjoyed them all. The movie definitely has its share of lame movie moments that kind of break the realism but for the most part it's gritty and interesting, and the wonky acting can't stop how fun it is.

  <summary>Generally unheralded at the time, the early 1980s hardcore punk rock scene gave birth to much of the rock music and culture that followed. Hardcore was more than music -- it was a social movement created by Reagan-era misfit kids. The participants constituted a tribe unto themselves -- some finding a voiced, others an escape in the hard-edged music. Ans while some sought a better world, others were just angry and wanted to raise hell. American Hardcore traces this lost subculture, from its early roots in 1980 to its initial flameout in 1986.

  <quote>Not a bad look into Bill Hicks by any means. That's all it tries to be, except they use an interesting (though sometimes off-putting) visual style. A good documentary for a brilliant comedian.</quote>

  <summary>After losing his job, his girlfriend, and his apartment in a single day, a young man attempts to restart his life, but is diverted when he meets a woman who shares his strangest habit</summary>
  <quote>It's good, it does most things well but doesn't exceed that. I have to admit that I was curious how it would handle the &quot;strangest habit&quot; but found that it didn't amount to anything substantial. There's a disgusting scene but it felt fast-tracked, and anywhere that calls this is a horror movie is grossly mislabeling it. Ultimately just a slightly strange romance movie but it had a little too much distance between viewer and movie to create a memorable relationship.</quote>

  <summary>After he's attacked on the street at night, timid bookkeeper Casey joins a neighborhood karate studio. Under the watchful eye of a charismatic instructor, Sensei, and hardcore brown belt Anna, Casey gains a newfound sense of confidence for the first time in his life. But when he attends Sensei's mysterious night classes, he discovers a sinister world of fraternity, brutality and hyper-masculinity, presenting a journey that places him squarely in the sights of his enigmatic new mentor.</summary>
  <quote>I really need more characters to dissect this, but simply put, if you follow the rhetoric these days of toxic masculinity then you probably agree with the message here. There's some truth, but it's not nuanced enough to give an accurate depiction. Besides that, just as a film, it's good. Uncomfortable, usually interesting, some brutal moments, some dry comedy, good performances all around, a little unpredictable. Gets compared to Fight Club--it's not nearly that clever, but still entertaining.</quote>

I, like others, found it extremely confusing and I don't know if that's due to the writing or just me being stupid.

  <quote>It's refreshing to see a Sci-Fi movie about AI and robots that become self-aware that doesn't actually make them bad guys. The premise of this is interesting because of that. However, there's some hokey acting here, it overstays its welcome a little bit, and the pacing is off on occasion. It's still a well shot movie with nice music, special effects and cinematography, but it doesn't end up being anything incredibly captivating.</quote>

It's visually beautiful and I like the effort put into the world but the script isn't anything amazing and is very inconsistent and plays to a few stupid Hollywood conventions. I appreciate the armed rebellion aspect but it should have gone deeper into it. Still, it's a very good sci-fi flick that everyone should see.</quote>

You get pretty much all positive things about Bogie, and the end was emotional and very well done. I suppose I just wanted more about him and their life, but it does what it sets out to do.</quote>

  <summary>A 6-story anthology collection in a time-line after &quot;Batman Begins&quot;.

  <quote>1: Just love Batman so I'm easy to impress. 2: The animation in the first one was awful and didn't work at all. The animation was uneven in general, some was great, some was not. 3: Even so, the story in the first was good. Liked the story in most of them, especially &quot;Working Through Pain.&quot; To seasoned Batman fans, the views into his psych aren't original but even so it's interesting. Field Test and &quot;Have I Got A Story For You&quot; are the weakest links. But all in all it's a good watch.</quote>

  <quote>Good but flawed. The character development isn't really there, making it difficult to invest in any of these characters. The relationships between the girls and the man feel forced. The photography is great though, using the locale very effectively; views from the outside a lot, whether it's the trees, someone looking to the outside world, etc, which in turn makes this house feel isolated. When it kicks it up a notch it gets more tense but then it's also rushed, not using the time wisely.</quote>

  <quote>Certainly has good elements like the attention to detail to actually make the birds scary, but this is not a Hitchcock movie that I absolutely adore. Suspense/horror films work better when there's good build but this goes from that to a little boring before stuff starts kicking it up. The finale is thrilling as the birds attack but I'm not so sure I like the actual ending. Still an entertaining flick but I'm disappointed while also being impressed by what it would have taken to make this in 63.</quote>

  <quote>I don't think it redefines the wheel in any way, but I dug Depp in the role (great performance, won't and shouldn't win awards though), and for the most part I was engaged. It dragged a little bit here and there, but it covered a fair bit of ground. Could have explored certain parts of Bulger's life better, but it's a completely solid gangster flick.</quote>

  <quote>When it's being a cyber-thriller, it's tense and interesting. Mann delivers another street shootout which is not quite Heat but it's great. In fact, the shootouts are a highlight with wonderful music backing them. The soundtrack as a whole is great. It loses its way at the end though, with the way everything becomes a little too convenient and unbelievable. Why can a huge group not see the guns? Shouldn't have made Hemsworth a super badass at everything. Weak writing at times as well.</quote>

  <quote>The bookends were effective, hitting the notes that Lee wanted. As a statement I appreciate the militant approach, and I think art needs more of that, but as a movie? It dragged really hard. Scenes went on too long, while trying to draw parallels he sometimes lost momentum. But Driver and Washington were compelling, it was even sometimes funny, and the dialogue was written well in general. But sometimes he took the easy way out in developing characters, such as the KKK. Liked, didn't love.</quote>

  <quote>I liked it. A couple decent plot twists and some fun action. Sure, the villain is just another corporate shithead which we see all the time in movies, but it didn't bother me that much. It's always hard to feel for Diesel because he's just not a good actor, but I didn't need to because what he is going through is easy to feel for. I suppose in a lot of ways this is disposable but I had a good time, much better than expected, so I'd say it's good.</quote>

  <quote>Started off really promising, felt like it was going to be more original. Ultimately it became a good murder mystery, which I'm completely okay with, but it could have been more. I liked seeing this kind of flick in a different type of setting, for the most part the acting was solid, but it lacked the kind of oomph that this kind of flick might need to put it over more. Thought the soundtrack was neat, directing was fine and I'm looking forward to seeing whatever they do next.</quote>

  <quote>It really heavily relies on the actors to make it believable and despite what goes on, you should mostly believe it, or at least suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy it. DiCaprio impressed me again but everyone was great. There's not much else that's great about it, though. The direction is rock solid, but it's Scott so you can expect that even if he's made some stinkers in his career (who hasn't?). It's a solid political thriller, see it once, never watch it again.</quote>

  <quote>Important, though I'm no expert on the actual incident so I don't know how much is moviefied. But I wouldn't say it's an awesome movie; the bookends are both great and some of the music is really excellent, adding to the tension, gravitas and dread. The part in the middle is decent, always entertaining but doesn't go beyond that. So it ends up being a good movie, not a great one. I would have liked a slightly deeper dive into the politics and characters.</quote>

  <quote>I thought I might absolutely love this because the opening scene, with Yellow, was profound to me for some reason. But as it went on, I started to realize I would merely like it. Which isn't bad by any means because I enjoyed myself, but it didn't grab me like it could have and didn't make me feel as emotional as it should have. However, great direction, the &quot;gimmick&quot; of filming these people over 12 years is interesting, and it's impressive that it didn't lose control of itself.</quote>

  <quote>Not quite a Buried clone, but fairly close. This has more action but the lead performance isn't nearly as strong. The plot in this has more at stake so I think in that way it's a little better, but the writing isn't as strong. It was predictable but I'll admit the last twist got me. Up until then I had pretty much guessed everything. I'm glad that extra twist was there.</quote>

  <quote>Certainly entertaining, not sure I'm seeing a movie worthy of the intense praise it seems to have gotten. I found most of the fight scenes lifeless, with the gory payoff the only interesting thing. Yet they didn't go far enough with the gore to make me grimace. But it was ridiculously silly, a nice genre piece that mashes up a prison drama and grindhouse... so it has that going for it. Vaughn gives no shits here, actually doing good work.</quote>

  <quote>Well it's a fantasy movie set in a technological dystopia. It mixes slapstick and a certain sadness of being in a dead end job in a society that is run by poorly maintained machines. It is a really visual movie... often times the stunning visuals actually take over the movie but I didn't really invest much into this movie, except for a couple scenes.</quote>

  <quote>This is competent and enjoyable for the most part, but it is flawed. Some of the dialogue is daft, and the script only hints at a compelling mythology; this could have been such a neat mash-up if they took the time to expand the lore rather than merely touching on it. It's a movie, the audience doesn't know everything that happened prior even if the characters do. I like Landis but the weakest part here is his writing, which feels weird to say. But still an enjoyable buddy cop fantasy flick.</quote>

It's not that she puts in real emotional work most of the time, she's just incredibly charming in the roles I've seen her in. And that really counts because this movie, like some others, isn't really a GREAT flick, but she makes it entertaining. Her energy drives this. Otherwise it's pretty well written but not substantial. Some of her dialogue is witty.</quote>

The worst offender is how Cthulhu itself looks... didn't feel as scary as it could have, which is a shame because when it appears it is framed in such a way that it should terrify. But I enjoyed it, the '20s vibe was fitting and it's a nice adaptation of interesting source material. Despite my gripes, some scenes are wonderful even though the film itself really isn't that scary.</quote>

  <quote>Outside of a couple laughs, generally by Tim Allen who is the star here, it doesn't really succeed as a comedy. The plot is not uncommon for a movie, but the reason these people are in there is a pretty decent setup. I enjoyed this a little more than I expected despite the shortcomings as a comedy because I actually felt something for these characters. By the end it made me a little emotional. So not a great flick by any means but another fun addition to Netflix.</quote>

The ending is strange in the sense that it ends exactly where it should for a cliffhanger but then they know that there won't be a sequel so in the credits it says that wars have broken out and the aliens are being overthrown, telling us the stuff we'd usually SEE in a sequel. I get that it's in line with the theme, but still.</quote>

  <summary>The story of an obsessively organized efficiency expert whose life unravels in unexpected ways when fate forces him to explore the serendipitous nature of love and forgiveness. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Definitely, Maybe and this are sort of similar, at least on the outside, and Definitely, Maybe is a better movie by far but I also enjoyed this for reasons I enjoyed that. Ryan Reynolds is great and I like him a lot generally, there are some kind of funny parts but the movie excels when it's being dramatic and by the end I did care about these people and their complex problems.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoyed it but wasn't madly in love with it or anything. The chemistry between father and son was there, and even though it really didn't do anything new with the genre (the indie dramedy/feel good story), it did it well. I didn't really find it that funny, but it was interesting and what little drama there was worked for me. The part with the 1 second videos edited together was genuinely touching. Also has a great soundtrack with reworkings of some classic songs.</quote>

I don't think anybody will say that this is an awesome movie but I'm going to go ahead and give this a 70 based solely on the fact that I was quite entertained the entire time while understanding it's not a substantial movie I wanna see again. There is a nice little mystery that keeps everything going, some tension, decent writing. If I ever got to a point where I didn't enjoy movies like this I wouldn't wanna watch movies anymore.</quote>

I can't see people who don't like him being that interested in this, to be honest, because it's not like he's this larger than life superstar. He's famous, no doubt, but he's no Justin Bieber -swoon-.</quote>

  <quote>By my scale this is a 'very good' so maybe I'm rating it too high, like Ytadel, but I agree with his/her review. Honestly; this is a fun little, unoriginal, but well acted movie. It does nothing you haven't seen a million times, but most of it is thrilling. It builds some tension, and even though I felt like the whole thing with the wife at the end was kind of wonky, I had a good time. If a movie entertains it gets a recommendation from me, and Contraband does.</quote>

  <quote>I wasn't in love with this flick. I didn't think it was that entertaining or anything or even that amazing from a film making perspective, except for the intelligence behind it, especially given the context of which it was made. It definitely examines the living conditions in a smart way. Oh, there was also a moment of inspired music as well but this is about it. It's not a dig really, everything else is competent just now awe-inducing. Still, it's IMPORTANT.</quote>

  <quote>Visually it's hard to find fault, because the building is a character in itself, and there is a rich Gothic aesthetic washing over everything. I also love how it plays out like a soap opera/live theatre show, and I enjoy how the dialogue reflects that. However, the script needs some serious work: there's a bunch of hokeyness here. Most notably, lazy metaphor work and some awkward scenes. The plot unfolds in a predictable way, but it still isn't what you'd expect from the trailer, which is cool.</quote>

Did have some heart, some cool music and 28 Days Later inspired style, it's a good entry in the zombie genre. Even the best parts were not exactly transformative, but everything was done well enough that this is a fine choice to watch.</quote>

  <quote>It can't reach greatness because the pacing is off, some scenes just go on too long and ultimately not a whole lot happens. But I did really enjoy it because it's an interesting take on the western with a few really good laughs. The way it riffs on the damsel in distress trope is easily the highlight, and Wasikowska puts in solid work. Add in some really beautiful scenes and you have a very good western that may not amaze but will certainly entertain. Seek it out because it's different.</quote>

  <quote>Would have been nice to see the other Justice League members get a fair shake, and really the fight between Superman and Doomsday goes on too long in comparison, but I still enjoyed it.

  <quote>Definitely give props to Jake here, and I gotta say that this movie was not really what I expected. The trailers made it seem tame and it's actually a little unhinged -- which I liked. It was interesting enough to keep me engaged even if it didn't go above and beyond; the transformation of this guy was intriguing. It had reoccurring and powerful symbolism, and the discussion of using the word &quot;fuck&quot; too much was glorious. A surprise for me, even if I'm not madly in love with it.</quote>

  <summary>A police raid in Detroit in 1967 results in one of the largest and most intense riots in United States history, leading to the federalization of the Michigan National Guard and the involvement of two Airborne Divisons of the United States Army.</summary>
  <quote>Enjoyable with a serious pacing issue. The bulk of it in the house wore really thin. I get it, show the horrors of what transpired that night, make it gritty with documentary-style intimacy, don't let the camera be static, make sure the blood and strife is clear; the problem was, it lost me a little, like it went on too long. I enjoyed the beginning, thought it was really well done, and the court stuff later was ok. I'm a little disappointed and think this could have been a more important film.</quote>

  <quote>Not quite the classic Kevin Smith pimps it as, but still great. I can't help but feel there's heavy Tarantino influence here, which is not weird considering Matt gets called Tarantino in it. The Dirties film they filmed for class was wonderful. The movie as a whole tackles its subject with finesse and the obsession with movies is a nice touch. You can feel for these people, I enjoy the ending and the &quot;we're only here for the bad guy&quot; shirt... because it's oddly fitting.</quote>

  <quote>The best part was Ferguson's character, who was a very menacing villain. The whole movie looks fine but obviously this doesn't hold a candle to The Shining. When they got to the hotel I was very in, I love seeing people in art return to the scene of their trauma after a long period, but then after the initial walkthrough it just felt very hollow. Hotel still looks cool but it lost a lot in the return and came across more as fan service done in a very mediocre way. Still an entertaining movie.</quote>

  <summary>About John Callahan who became paralyzed after a car accident at age 21, and turned to drawing as a form of therapy. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's fine with a good performance by everyone, especially Phoenix and Hill... but Black put in really underrated work for the limited time he was in it. Some of it was hokey, some scenes were unnecessarily repetitive, there was some pretty good humour. The cartoons were great, once it leaned more into that it became a much better movie. I didn't know who Callahan is so I can't speak to accuracy, but this does seem slight compared to what I imagine he experienced.</quote>

Luke is in the midst of marriage talks with his girlfriend of six years, Kate is playing it cool with her music producer boyfriend Chris. But you know what makes the line between &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;more than friends&quot; really blurry? Beer. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>What ultimately ends up being the destruction of a friendship, ends on a note that suggests the re-building of it (or more?). It's kind of a non-ending in that sense but that's fine. Not every movie needs a real resolution. Drinking Buddies creates a world with believable characters and relationships, and that in itself is an accomplishment. Well acted and well shot, this is a step forward for the director. This is the third Swanberg movie I've seen and the only one I like so far.</quote>

But in the wilds of Caledonia, the soldier and his British slave (Jamie Bell) encounter fierce native tribes and other dangers. Kevin Macdonald directs this adaptation of Rosemary Sutcliff's novel.</summary>
  <quote>You know, going against what I expected when going in, I thoroughly enjoyed this. I thought it had a great visual sense, and even Mumbles Tatum did a good job. Some parts were by the book but that's not a bad thing if done well, and for the most part it is. I was interested the whole way through. Some of the action scenes were inspired but sometimes I wish these movies wouldn't film everything so zoomed in... zoom out once in a while and let the action breathe.</quote>

I'm giving props to the lead male actor, giving an understated but effective performance. There are a few scares in here but don't go in really expecting a horror movie because ghosts only show up a few times and the rest of it is a drama, basically.</quote>

  <quote>I'm going to give this a 70 because I admire it, not because I overly enjoyed it. The last hour or so was compelling but the other three hours was considerably less so. But it's a movie with an interesting (and challenging) style, opting for more close-up intimate shots almost exclusively; lots of shots of backs, walking and sitting. Very sad in its washed out colours and character actions. Wonderful soundtrack. But nothing happens most of the time. It didn't need 4 hours.</quote>

Unfortunately, by that time we were at least halfway through. Finn is fantastic and charming.</quote>

  <quote>So much is wrong about Paige's story and some things are shortened way too much while other things are given too much time. WWE Studios has their hands all over this but you know, just as a feel good movie about wrestling it succeeds. It's basically a story the WWE would use, and it was surprisingly emotional, along with being well acted. As an aside, I wish I could go back in time and see the WWE has a magical place like this film does.</quote>

  <summary>During the Vietnam War, a supernatural presence threatens the lives of the soldiers stationed there. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>So far, both Rakka and this have ended a little abruptly, but Firebase is more guilty of that, which makes it feel a little cheap/less satisfying. Obviously there's going to be another part but it literally ends right before some shit is going to happen. It's a shame because I do quite enjoy the rest of it, even if it's not exceptional... well that's a lie, the beginning is perfect, but it does lose a little bit of steam before it gains it back. Still, another fun Oats short.</quote>

  <summary>A look at the life of the astronaut, Neil Armstrong, and the legendary space mission that led him to become the first man to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's really hard to shit on the technical aspects of this because most of it works. Gosling is great, the cinematography brings the imagery to life, the camera work itself is wonderful without being too flashy, the music is mostly interesting, and Chazelle brings it all together. Sometimes this brought some real humanity (the ending specifically) to the event, but honestly? It's a pretty dry, too slow, sometimes lifeless experience. Writing wasn't always there to be a compelling drama.</quote>

  <summary>A sexually curious teen forms an unorthodox kinship with her mentally unstable stepbrother. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I won't sit here and say that I didn't enjoy it because I did. I wasn't bored, and at times I was pretty into it. If it wasn't for Deutch's commitment to this it would have flopped, but she puts in good work. This is just fluff, nonchalantly dealing with things like pedophilia, rape, etc. with no real consequences or depth. And yet that energy and attitude was kind of refreshing; it's a movie so unafraid to go that route. Not amazing, not much of a comedy, but fun.</quote>

  <summary>With her husband away indefinitely, a young mother struggles to nurture her son in the face of poverty, isolation and incarceration. FLUTTER explores the truest love on earth-the love of a mother and child. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Flutter is a decent enough drama but there are some issues holding it back on its way to greatness, namely, due to the apparent laziness of the mother, it is easy to question the love she has for her son. It is never explained why she has money problems (just throw in a few lines for gods sake), so even though we are bombarded with her love for him, that is an underlying point of contention. It's still a solid drama in every other way though.</quote>

  <summary>A treatise about methods of gaining power, the film features characters who are shown from a bird's eye view and resemble pawns on a chessboard more than people.</summary>
  <quote>After I read more about this, I started appreciating it more. I do like the birds eye view of the people, I think it's a nice touch. Also, the animation is simple but it gets the point across. The way they walk to the music also enforces the idea that the director was trying to get across (a swipe at the Poland system at the time). I went from not recommending this to giving it a 70 in a pretty short time. I guess I just wasn't sure what I was watching at first. Once you know, it's good.</quote>

  <quote>I was going to rate it an 80 because I actually really liked the ending (the song and moment was moving), but I waited a bit until I was off the &quot;high&quot; of it and the rest of the movie doesn't really deserve an 80. It's a quirky -- though sometimes seemingly just to be quirky -- and oddball movie, but I didn't find it overly funny or dramatic. It worked though as a satire and bromance, and was an enjoyable movie through and through. Just not a GREAT movie. Still definitely worth a watch though.</quote>

  <summary>Set in Boston in 1978, a meeting in a deserted warehouse between two gangs turns into a shootout and a game of survival. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I certainly enjoyed it. It's basically Mad Max for shootouts, as has been said in here already, and in this it basically succeeds. There are some good laughs and gore; it's a fittingly ugly film where people spend most of it shooting at each other, hitting all kinds of limbs and then crawling around on the floor after they've been shot themselves. I think it loses some of its luster after a while, but as a simple genre piece it's fun and worth a view, especially to see a solid cast.</quote>

  <quote>It doesn't astound the audience, outside of Tucker actually being competent and perhaps even a little bit likable, but it's a fun enough comedy about a couple of dudes lazing around, smoking weed and talking shit. Not as funny as it could have been, but some good laughs exist like, &quot;I saw the window open so I said 'fuck it.'&quot; What makes it a little bit better than an average comedy is that I found myself caring for the characters.</quote>

  <summary>This raucous rom-com chronicles the relationship of two busy singles, Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis), who agree to include sex in their friendship -- minus the emotions and commitment. But things get complicated when Dylan (inevitably?) falls for his gal pal. Patricia Clarkson co-stars as Jaime's hip mom and Woody Harrelson plays Dylan's practical confidante, who advises him to man up when he pursues the newly dating Jamie.</summary>
  <quote>I'm not really sure which I like more, this or No Strings, but I'll tell you that I like Portman more than Kunis, Timberlake more than whatshisface. There were some good laughs. And the plot moved along like most rom-coms. Fair 'nuf.</quote>

Aside from that, it's not a remarkable dramedy but it's not a bad one. It has some good laughs, some heart and teaches us--admittedly--the same kind of stuff that this genre is known for. But it entertains, and that's what we want.</quote>

  <quote>Terrible script that keeps bluntly telling us how close these people are, also with cheesy dialogue. Over the top and stupid action. Shots of Vin Diesel's face and the city, glitz and glamour. A plot that doesn't matter. Oh yeah, also really enjoyable. It's just junk food, and the silly action is a lot of fun. It rides that line of being a little TOO much at times, but for the most part it is actually a thrill ride despite being a pretty bad movie in a lot of ways.  Nice tribute at the end too.</quote>

With that said, I'm seeing some low scores now and I don't understand because it's an interesting enough genre flick with a few twists and turns, enough to be entertaining. I just wish I had never seen the trailer, and this is kinda like Gone Girl but not as good.</quote>

  <summary>Fueled by a raging libido, Wild Turkey, and superhuman doses of drugs, Thompson was a true &quot;free lance, &quot; goring sacred cows with impunity, hilarity, and a steel-eyed conviction for writing wrongs. Focusing on the good doctor's heyday, 1965 to 1975, the film includes clips of never-before-seen (nor heard) home movies, audiotapes, and passages from unpublished manuscripts. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I was hoping to love this docu since Thompson is such a fascinating guy. I learned a few things here and there but some of the presentation choices were lame and dull. Other parts were more inspired. This is a decent doc for people who want to know a bit about the man but don't know tons already.</quote>

  <quote>Good but after a solid beginning it could have been better. Part of those expectations also come from Glover, who tends to subvert to some degree... and while this has a nice message, it doesn't do a lot to really stand out. The 4:3 ratio that seems to appear in a couple movies each year now doesn't really add much, coming off more like a gimmick than anything meaningful. Rihanna wasn't used well.</quote>

  <summary>Laurie Strode comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers, the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's good but Carpenter understood atmosphere in a way that Green doesn't. The OG was only occasionally creepy but still excited because of that, this wasn't nearly as foreboding and ominous as I expected it to be. Myers is still compelling because he is just evil and trying to understand him is a waste of time. The beginning was intense but then all of it up until he gets out and starts killing is average. Feels a little like it's going through the motions;  unnecessary but still entertaining.</quote>

  <summary>Hanzo is not your typical constable. He is well known in Edo. He is equal parts Dirty Harry, Robocop, and John Holmes. Hanzo's techniques are far from clean. His ends justify his means. (IMDB Comments)</summary>
  <quote>Hanzo is terrible, but that makes him an interesting character to watch. He uses any method available to get what he wants; we've seen plenty of torturing and blackmail in movies, but this dude legit rapes girls and then they fall for him (?). So that's bound to shock people, but to be honest, the second rape is silly, as she is hung up and spins on his weenie. Anyway, ultimately it's an entertaining samurai flick with some cool shots and action, and the blaxploitation soundtrack is unexpected.</quote>

  <summary>Irresponsible 20-something Jenny arrives in Chicago to live with her older brother Jeff, a young filmmaker living a happy existence with his novelist wife Kelly and their two-year-old son. Jenny's arrival shakes up their quiet domesticity as she and her friend Carson instigate an evolution in Kelly's life and career. Meanwhile, Jenny strikes up a rocky relationship with the family's baby sitter-cum-pot dealer (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It started off terrible and I thought it would be another Swanberg flop but it turned itself around. At first it seemed like everyone was just overreacting to situations and it didn't seem natural but it became more organic as time went on and though the movie is small, it's a nice look at a specific moment in time with characters that do feel alive. It got a little humorous and believable. The baby kicks a lot of ass too... genuinely funny.</quote>

  <summary>Follows the lonely, twisted trek of a medieval bounty hunter who seeks vengeance on the monster that killed his only daughter. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>If you can accept the fact that it's limited due to its budget--meaning you will really only see the monster heads for the most part instead of him actually fighting--then this is actually quite a solid flick. It's moody with gorgeous cinematography that brilliantly details the forest. Rygh puts in respectable work with minimal dialogue, having to rely more on physical acting. The ending was a nice little bit of icing, and holy shit the armor looks cool. A slow burn, but mostly rewarding.</quote>

  <quote>Honestly, it can feel a little silly at times. It's not all the time but it does happen. However, I admire what it's trying to say about depression/psychosis, and I think Brie did a really great job here, showcasing her skills in &quot;going crazy&quot; and being sad, while also reminding us how good she is at awkward loners. Some interesting visuals, and though it's not told flawlessly, the story is interesting. It's a little slow to get going but once it does it's worth the wait.</quote>

  <quote>Bale is always a pleasure. The writing is solid, giving a little bit of depth to the characters and conflict. It's a little tedious and predictable as a whole, but I'm a sucker for this kind of cinematography/direction, meaning I enjoy wide shots of fields, basically. The beauty of how it is filmed offsets the boredom for the most part. It's fairly contemplative but not exactly awe-inspiring in that regard, but hey, I like a moody Western.</quote>

  <quote>The love for Scorsese and The Big Short is strong here, but it's a lesser film, not having the same energy. Despite that, Robbie is great as the titular Tonya, and the way Rogers approached writing this was for the best; I had no interest in seeing this but the opening bit intrigued me, I thought I might come out loving it. It dragged, rarely hit the comedy notes it wanted to while also never delivering the drama like it needed. Has too much good in it to merely be average though.</quote>

  <quote>I think while the subject is certainly interesting and disgraceful, the documentary itself is not compelling. There are moments of real intrigue here, and I thought for the first little bit this would be great. But then it loses its momentum, drowning its subject matter in tedium, unnecessary explanations and conversations being thrown into the mix. Then it gets back on track a little. Rodchenkov is also a fascinating man. It's a good doc that borders on great occasionally.</quote>

  <quote>It's good, it's not great, but I love Jin-Roh from 1998, I love the design of the suits (specifically the masks). I wish they hadn't changed when/where it took place, especially since their design fits better with the alternate history aesthetic. The pacing is off (it's like 40 minutes extra of bloat), it kind of just meanders along for a while, but the bookends are fun. I'm glad they had the early sewer part because I loved that scene in the original too. Great photography as well.</quote>

  <summary>A monk and his three disciples continue on their journey to battle demons.</summary>
  <quote>A bit of a step down from the previous one, but still fun. As in the first, I love when the main theme hits in the middle of a battle, and some of the fighting is quite epic. Definitely has a better final battle, probably better action as a whole, but I didn't laugh as much and it came across like a bit of a retread, despite in being more about the journey of a group rather than one man. Also lacks the compelling female character Duan from the first, except for a few parts.</quote>

  <quote>Funnier and a little more emotional than expected. Great casting and I like this Hart/Rock dynamic they got going on. Really, the Rock elevates most of the movies he's in because his charm is alluring. Some really good jokes here and the ones I didn't laugh at didn't elicit a groan from me, meaning that hey, no comedy will get you 100% of the time but at least the jokes aren't shit.</quote>

  <quote>I predicted half of the ending, meaning I knew who one of them were; the reveal of the second was a surprise and it helped make up a pretty great ending. The rest of the movie was good enough. As many others have noted, it slowly turns from a drama to a horror. It mostly succeeded as a horror from an imagery and weirdness perspective, though I didn't find it scary. It took too long to get to it and the family stuff wasn't that compelling. Recommend it to people who want something odd.</quote>

  <quote>Whereas I enjoyed Hard-Boiled and was quite forgiving of the cheesiness, and thus willing to get right to the violence, this is a little much. The story is just not interesting, and while the shootouts are certainly entertaining, it's not enough to make this a great flick. It's enjoyable though, and there are moments--such as when he does accidentally shoot the singer--that flirt with some severity, only to squander that with tedium. But, shooting!</quote>

  <quote>I liked it but I feel disappointed. It's definitely not on the level of Jesse James. I appreciate the satire, and there are moments I love (beginning, end, some other parts). The slow pace mostly works but sometimes I found my mind wandering. I enjoyed the dialogue sometimes but it lacks 'oomph' sometimes: a reason to want to listen. When the movie is on it's ON. But what bothers me the most is that I thought this would be a movie that haunts my mind after, and it's not.</quote>

  <quote>I clearly did not love this like other people did, but I certainly didn't hate it. There were some dips where I wasn't that entertained, but it did redeem itself. It has an amazing cast but the problem was that almost none of them had enough to do. They almost all deserved more. Ana de Armas was a pleasant standout. I'm not sure what I expected exactly from the actual mystery but even though it was solid enough, I was still a little disappointed. Didn't feel that suspenseful.</quote>

  <quote>Anytime you deal with this kind of stuff you run the risk of propagating certain ideas that aren't entirely true, so you have to thread carefully and hit the factual stuff and ignore propaganda. This does that sometimes, and even when it fails I wasn't put off. On top of that, it had some pretty decent laughs but not enough to be a great comedy. It sacrificed those for heart, which it did succeed in. As noted, Thompson was the standout here.</quote>

  <quote>This was pretty solid. Some of it was a little wonky and didn't go in such a great direction, but when it comes down to it... I could appreciate that it wasn't totally black and white in how it portrayed Christians OR atheists. Usually it's easier to just stereotype so film makers cheap out and do that. But these people really exist, and there's good and bad in both of them. Ultimately, the one character becomes the villain, but that's fine. It also didn't cheap out on the ending!</quote>

Great animation, of course, and the way its characters is pretty impressive. This is an entertaining Batman but the entire rogues gallery is handled with finesse.</quote>

  <quote>Every review I've read about this is basically people hating on it because of their own morals. They throw criticisms like &quot;poor script&quot; around but it's not a poor script. It's good and the characters are decently fleshed out. Reviewers feel uncomfortable with the romance because it's a 29 year old and a teenager. They judge the characters without realizing that these &quot;cliches&quot; exist, the troubled kid who skateboards exist. The movie isn't groundbreaking, but it's a good hour and a half.</quote>

  <quote>Nice idea in putting Explosions in the Sky music in there somewhere... usually adds some weight to scenes. Why am I reviewing EitS?

I think I wanted it to examine him more than it did, but oh well, it was still entertaining. Plus we got to listen to Sonnen and that's always fun.</quote>

  <quote>It flirts with big and sometimes conflicting ideas, which I admire, but somehow I came out of it feeling that it was a little insubstantial. Which it shouldn't, considering the subject matter. But I guess I should give it more credit for even attempting to deal with certain things. Aside from that, I think Harrison Jr. was inconsistent, but everyone else was great-- very much a case of a few powerhouse actors outdoing a less accomplished actor. Still good if uneven with unfinished plot threads.</quote>

  <quote>It's a good movie. Hell, a 70 just hits very good for me, but it's not a great film. It's very spotty as doctor7 said, and it's a big build up (that isn't really well done but not poorly done neither), for a little bit of action. The cheese sometimes works, it didn't really bug me, but I had a hard time really getting connected. It didn't have the emotional oomph it should have.</quote>

  <quote>Having come into Villeneuve's world with Prisoners it's interesting to see what he was doing 18 years ago. Apparently making weird movies. I'm not infatuated with this one, don't think it's his finest work by any means, but he does show signs of the greatness to come in. Croze put in really good work as the lead and Denis made some interesting choices in terms of how it looks, but there's a feeling that the weirdness is there to cover weaknesses. Still a good movie though.</quote>

  <quote>As others have noted, the horror here is incredibly slight, almost non-existent really. Outside of the general atmosphere, a few scarier images and the Gothic setting, it's more of a drama. With that said, if you separate yourself from what you assume it will be it's pretty good at what it does, with an emotional backbone that paid off. It's not something I will necessarily remember for years to come but it was a pleasant surprise.</quote>

  <quote>It's not going to go down in history as one of the great movies by animators from Ghibli, but it will certainly go down as something worth a watch. The visuals are what you'd expect, which means they're vibrant and amazing; the story is sweet and heartfelt though a tad forgettable and predictable. It doesn't carry a lot of weight, doesn't offer us a real message, but is entertaining for the whole family.</quote>

However, there are elements where it rises above simply being good; namely, Sally Hawkins, who is great as the titular Maudie. This is an emotional movie, but that was expected, and Maudie was incredibly endearing, but what I didn't predict was that it would be pretty funny.</quote>

Along the way, Sam explores metals' obsession with some of life's most provacative subjects - sexuality, religion, violence and death - and discovers some things about the culture that even he can't defend. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Really, this is just a beginners look into metal. I agree with the person who said you'd need hours and hours to really get into the genre (but you can say that about most genres). It's clear that Sam loves metal so in that way it's very much a love letter and it speaks the language of a lot of metalheads, but there just isn't a lot of information there -- it just scratches the surface most of the time. There are some great parts, and it's decent all around so it's worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>I try to keep any sociopolitical opinions I have out of these reviews but I have to say, I like Swift's music but when she's spouting off the shallow rhetoric that modern feminism is a slave to she's not very endearing. But besides that, there's real intimacy here and it's well shot. I imagine Swift fans will really like this as it's a good look into her life and whatever struggles she has had. I appreciated the honesty and think she needlessly gets shit on by a loud group of people.</quote>

  <quote>I think it was fine, just like the Lumet one. The Lumet one had better direction but this was entertaining enough. It's a good little murder mystery, a fun ride, but then after it's over there's really no reason to watch it again. Decent performances all around, nothing really stands out. But ultimately it's just one of those movies I give a 70 because it entertained to the point that I wasn't really bored, nor was I fully invested.</quote>

But I can't say I was overly enjoying it. However, it is really emotionally, specifically the ending bit which just about killed me as well. So I give it a 70 because it was so powerful by the end.</quote>

  <quote>I'm willing to give it a 70 because of the few great scenes (the beginning, the unexpected killings and the ending) but the rest of it is an example of arthouse trickery that hides something... possibly shallowness. The camera often lingers, but it's too much and actually disengages us, and the minimalist, almost non-existent, dialogue between the characters makes it hard for us to know or care. This is a case of going for TOO much mystery, but you have to let us in sometimes.</quote>

  <quote>I think I appreciate it more than I like it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but the importance here is in the technical aspects. The camera work, cinematography, direction is all on point, and the pickpocketing scenes are fun (especially the one in the train). But the acting zapped any of the emotion out of it for me. Though I have limited experience with Bresson as of this, I understand his emphasis on miminalism. It's just... they're basically trees.</quote>

On a serious note, I did like the idea of bank robbers being Ex-Presidents and there could have been great commentary there if this movie wasn't so cheesy.</quote>

  <quote>I am so conflicted. On one end, some of this just dragged hard. Not a lot happened, and I felt the movie sometimes tried too hard to be atmospheric and beautiful. On the other end, the Explosions in the Sky OST helped tremendously (though one particular scene I thought the music was great but was used poorly and the scene was cheesy), and I always enjoy Rudd. By the end of the film, it gave me a feeling that maybe I witnessed something important, despite the flaws. So I guess I liked it.</quote>

  <quote>Rhys Wakefield was the MAN in this. What a creepy and wonderful performance. I think the premise works as a decent talking point, not that a purge would ever actually happen. I went to see it because it isn't just another &quot;family moves into haunted house&quot; horror movie. The beginning up to a certain point I thought it was wonderful, but the last quarter or so, it flip-flopped on silly or good. Heavy social commentary? Yes, but that's not even a problem.</quote>

  <quote>It works well as just a solid black Bonnie and Clyde film, because for the most part it's solidly paced with good performances and some emotional depth. I don't have enough characters to get into the social commentary but it's pretty basic, perhaps even uninformed at times (as many of these movies are). To its credit though, it doesn't get bogged down in the messaging and some of it is true, even if I cringed a bit at times. Could have been more clever, but it's entertaining enough.</quote>

  <quote>It lacks the emotional and character depth of the novel, but I had a good time. I'm not so jaded as to not enjoy references of things I like so long as there is a narrative present, which there is. It may not be deep or original but it's there and told in a way that is ultimately FUN. The best parts take the references and use them in an engaging and unexpected way. It doesn't always do that, but the references never detract from the experience anyway. Very good, fun flick but not great.</quote>

  <quote>During the build-up it got silly and cartoonish sometimes, like zooming in on the guy eating. But there were other dumb parts like that and it didn't fit the subject matter. The actual revenge part is better; it doesn't do anything new and the desert setting gets a little bland (instead of becoming a character itself), but ultimately it's satisfying and bloody. Despite my criticisms, it at least had a fairly intriguing style, even if it didn't always work. A good, but not great, revenge film.</quote>

  <quote>Some interesting visuals with a couple nice, atmospheric shots of Kazakhstan. A slow plot where very little happens, but it shows the conditions of rural Kazakhstan. Surprising to me since I'm not aware of them but to anybody who is, then it probably isn't. Acting is solid but not amazing. Fight scenes are pretty gory and realistic. It's pretty clean too, meaning, it doesn't beat you over the head with anything. Kind of like Elephant, it just examines the situation.</quote>

I'm a weirdo who loved the Snyderverse and while they've certainly MCU'd up since, there is an element of darkness here that I enjoyed.</quote>

  <quote>In a day and age where Hollywood action sequences are shaky cams and quick cuts, it was nice to see the brother v brother fight be more restrained.

The rest of the movie is definitely enjoyable with a few good moments but it lost me sometimes. Still, Miike was showcasing some directorial charm here even if it's fairly average up until a certain point.</quote>

Some of the musical choices were really try-hard, attempting to add some kind of, I don't know, class to this? That was something in the trailer I didn't like too.

Aided by Frankie Cook (Jolie), commander of an all-female amphibious squadron, and technical genius Dex (Ribisi), Polly and Sky Captain may be our planet's only hope.  (Paramount)</summary>
  <quote>The usage of monochromatic properties is both a blessing and a curse. It has a very distinct visual style and I embrace it for that, but unlike something like Sin City, which also has a unique digital backlot style, the visuals don't always pop. It's kind of hard to see things once in a while. Low on story, interesting blend of genres like action, adventure, pulpy film noir, sci-fi. Ultimately, a fun family adventure with a few laughs here and there.</quote>

  <summary>A young street magician (Jacob Latimore) is left to care for his little sister after their parents passing, and turns to illegal activities to keep a roof over their heads. When he gets in too deep, his sister is kidnapped, and he is forced to use his magic and brilliant mind to save her.</summary>
  <quote>Good work from a debut. There's nothing exceptional here and it certainly doesn't avoid clichés, but it's a competent origin story. Some of the acting can be a little hammy, and it doesn't go anywhere that exciting, but it tells a gritty tale of a kid trying to do what's right. I also like magicians, so the fact he is one of them helps me enjoy it a little more. This doesn't redefine the superhero genre, but it's a pretty good example of it if you want to see something that isn't DCEU or MCU.</quote>

  <quote>I didn't even really want to see this but felt obligated to and I think it's better than both of the new episodes but not as good as Rogue One. I guess the SW stories are where it's at for me. This is fun in a way that both TFA and TLJ were not; not overstuffed, decent action all around, some heart, some good humour, good cinematography except it was kind of dark at the beginning. The new characters weren't as memorable as Rogue One and this wasn't necessary, but hey, I enjoyed it.</quote>

However, the first half was interesting and when they talked about how digital killed SC, that is fascinating documentary material.

  <quote>Plods a little but is shot well, though I think the way it's shot makes it potentially more challenging. There are some absolutely beautiful scenes, however, there's also a certain coldness and isolation to it in regards to where the camera places itself, the way it lingers, the distance and even the sets themselves. It fits thematically, doesn't always make for the most compelling view... I however think the directing, knowing that, was really good.</quote>

  <quote>I like it but I think the Craig version of Bond is running its course. That's not the fault of Craig, it is just becoming familiar and predictable. It starts out on a high note, with the excellent Day of the Dead atmosphere, but it doesn't maintain that. Waltz does a good job but they try WAY too hard to make him seem like an evil evil bad guy, and I didn't feel like the action sequences always worked. Could have been trimmed a bit too... that may have helped it.</quote>

  <quote>I consider this trilogy &quot;good&quot; because they serve as pretty entertaining sci-fi/action films but that's about it. I enjoy them, but the magic isn't there. Admittedly Ren's arc was better than the previous episodes but I still don't buy Driver as that character. The rest of the characters are whatever, and I think that's the main problem. Also, they continue the tradition of completely misusing potentially cool characters... seriously, that's it from the Knights of Ren?</quote>

  <quote>I had 8 stars for my original review but I had to re-evaluate my thoughts on this, so, sorry people. It's still a great movie, but it is quite safe, I realized that I wasn't introduced to any characters that I fell in love with, and I was suffering from the high of just having come out of a Star Wars movie with my friends. With that said, it's fun, there's some good action, the script is fairly intelligent and humorous. Actors do a good job and the world-building is still ace.</quote>

  <quote>It's a good movie that occasionally reaches greatness. Looks great, the universe is still fantastic, but now the bad: There was an opportunity here to do something unique and it didn't do it. Some hokey dialogue and acting here and there, a trilogy built on the backs of uninteresting characters but they were a little better here; I am fine with a formula but it needs something to invest in. The final act was a lot of fun.  Some scenes were brilliant.</quote>

It doesn't strive to be more than what it is, and it succeeded in being a fun retro-noir.</quote>

  <summary>At the edge of adolescence, Tracy is a smart straight-A student--if not a little naive (it seems...she smokes and she cuts to alleviate the emotional pain she suffers from having a broken home and hating her mom's boyfriend, Brady.) When she befriends Evie, the most popular and beautiful girl in school, Evie leads Tracy down a path of sex, drugs and petty crime (like stealing money from purses and from stores)...

  <summary>The powerful but arrogant warrior Thor is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard and sent to live amongst humans on Earth, where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.</summary>
  <quote>By the numbers, but entertaining. Unnecessary characters abound, but at least they got a good cast to do it. Which I guess speaks to the philosophy of the movie: make a good time. Who cares if the character played by Kat is unnecessary and the character played by Portman is very very simplistic? It doesn't matter! It's Kat and Natalie! I don't give a shit and neither should you, go see it because it's entertaining. I don't even like Thor as a character, for the record. But he's done well.</quote>

  <quote>I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I think it got a little weaker when they were actually raiding the tomb, oddly enough. Vikander was great, putting in a physical performance but having some good emotional depth and charm. Some of the action, specifically in the first half or so reminded me of Die Hard (no, not as good) in the sense that it was someone out of their element and it was gritty. I liked that she actually had pause when she first murdered someone. This was fun.</quote>

  <quote>I pretty much agree that as strictly a documentary it is very biased and fails on that level but I don't have a problem with it picking a side. However, I found the 3 dudes interesting because from what I can gather, one does it for fun, the other is political and the other is um... angry and likes the more technical side. It kind of tackles all the sides of why people do this stuff. Would it have been better if it tackled the issue with more depth? Yeah, but it is what it is.</quote>

  <quote>Its plot is lesser than the first and it's not as funny but I enjoyed it more than the first. Optimus Prime was more badass in this and really that's what I wanted to see. The robot fights were incredibly entertaining and again you get a love story that's predictable but it helps hold whatever narrative this has together. So meh, I just won't watch this a second time like the first one so my opinion on it stays the same.</quote>

I question why there aren't subtitles as it doesn't seem to have the intended effect... just muddles things needlessly.</quote>

  <quote>Yeah, definitely messy as already stated, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't quite entertained by this. It is so 80s in probably the worst way, with the expected visual style and numerous dance/music numbers. But then it tries to be a high school drama and a gang movie at the same time? Then there's the last act, which has some completely ridiculous action going on. There's some unintentional comedy like Robert Downey rollin' in with dogs, and... well, it's fun.</quote>

  <quote>Obviously knowing how this was shot allows a person to appreciate it more, but even if you don't I think it is shot well enough to be seen as claustrophobic and intimate. I could have done with more guessing about whether or not she truly is crazy because that was the most entertaining part (even if it's been done a million times before). I was entertained the entire time but the final act is a little uneven; however the final shot is somehow incredibly creepy (good music). Foy put in good work.</quote>

  <quote>A grimy sci-fi revenge flick that was certainly entertaining the entire time, while not being especially memorable. But that's okay because all I really need from these genre flicks is a good time, and it delivers. Sometimes Marshall-Green's acting left a little to be desired, but for the most part he was passable. The violence was pretty brutal and unflinching, but as a whole it didn't exactly add a whole lot to the genre. But again, that's okay.</quote>

It becomes clear that each one of them has wronged Söze at some point and must pay back now. The payback job leaves 27 men dead in a boat explosion, but the real question arises now: Who actually is Keyser Söze? (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>What hurts this is what TrixRabbi said: there's a lot of dead weight. Scenes could be shorter, and therefore crisper, and there are moments that didn't need to exist. It's two and a half hours and would have a wonderful plot if it was trimmed quite a bit. There's a lot of talent on display here though, such as the mixture of comedy and horror (early on, mostly). It's also gorgeous with a foreboding atmosphere. The ending would be really crushing if it didn't take way too long to get there.</quote>

It was pretty lighthearted but I wasn't as into it as I wish I could have be. I don't even know if there's a specific reason why it left me feeling a little more cold than it should have; maybe because I didn't find it that funny nor did the drama overly engage me. Still a well acted and shot movie.</quote>

  <quote>There is one scene fairly late on that really got me. I didn't see it coming and when it happened I got that &quot;oh shit...&quot; feeling that so few horror movies really make me feel. From that point on this is a GREAT movie; a little unpredictable, impactful, good sense of atmosphere and tension. The problem is that up until that point it kind of hums along with some occasionally sub-par acting and dialogue, not offering a whole lot. That's what holds this back.</quote>

Oh well, this is a solid flick, good comic book entertainment. Interesting, good action sequences, and Wolverine -- despite what I just said -- is still a badass.</quote>

Does it make you miss those rivalries? The answer to both of those questions is &quot;yes,&quot; and that's why it succeeds and is worth a watch.</quote>

Along the way he encounters Haruka, a distressed young girl who is trying to find her lost mother. Unfortunately Kiryu's problems slowly escalate as he is pursued by a former associate, the baseball bat-wielding psycho Majima Goro who has a grudge to settle with Kiryu. (imdb User Comments)</summary>
  <quote>As a film it leaves a little to be desired. I feel like being a Yakuza fan is a must (i am), otherwise its hard to follow because the movie doesnt go into any depth about who these people are. But its got good action and the Yakuza charm without the necessary depth that the video games give you to push the story even further. Still, I had a good time even if the source material gave Miike a lot more to work with than he used.</quote>

  <quote>Pretty solid. Has a great soundtrack, gotta admit. It's very arty and uses its images and metaphors to examine communication and love and whatnot; to what extent it succeeds is up for debate. I think it does a good job, but this isn't a movie that's going to blow your mind by any means. The beginning and end are inspired but the movie suffers throughout the middle. It's in that area where it just reeks of thinking it's deeper than it is, but it ultimately isn't awful or anything.</quote>

  <quote>It's a shame that they didn't take the main idea from the comics, at least. Super villains killing off all the super heroes is a good idea. But this movie, separated from the comic, isn't bad but it's not great. Everything in it is passable and while it goes too far sometimes with its commentary, it is an action movie that kind of makes you think. But not too much, because the emphasis is on action. Sometimes the slow mo is too much but all in all it's a fun movie.</quote>

It's not consistently funny, and you might go long portions without a laugh, but there were some really good laughs in there.</quote>

  <summary>Indifferent even to the prospects of inheriting his father's estate, Swanson has been insulated his whole life by the bubble of privilege. He and his hipster friends live in a tepid social paradise, a.k.a. Williamsburg, where their good fortune breeds indifference and recreational cruelty. They pacify their discontent with games of mock sincerity and irreverence, as though humor itself were dying and had nothing left to do but turn on itself. (mubi.com)</summary>
  <quote>The movie didn't really make me feel uncomfortable, but I get it. It does a good job of showing us a guy who's detached from everything. Ultimately I just didn't really care about what was going on. I guess it was kinda boring, it didn't strike a fun balance of pointlessness like a Korine movie does. Sometimes it just feels like a bad indie movie... yeah perhaps it was satirizing some of that, but other times it just messed with whatever flow the movie had. I give it props for being challenging.</quote>

  <summary>On the eve of WWI, Zurich and Vienna are the setting for a dark tale of sexual and intellectual discovery. Drawn from true-life events, the film takes a glimpse into the turbulent relationships between fledgling psychiatrist Carl Jung (Fassbender), his mentor Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), and Sabina Spielrein (Knightley), the troubled but beautiful young woman who comes between them. Into the mix comes Otto Gross (Cassel), a debauched patient who is determined to push the boundaries. (beyondhollywood.com)</summary>
  <quote>It is what it is.  Almost at a &quot;very good&quot; but not quite. I enjoyed the dynamics between everyone. Really I don't have any serious complaints, as I felt the writing was fine and even though philosophically, it's fascinating stuff, I felt like it's about two dudes and a damaged chick who sit around talking about stuff average people don't understand, and it accomplishes this. At the risk of sounding ignorant, what else could be done with this besides what was done?</quote>

  <summary>Tells the story of a city girl who moves to a small town and becomes entangled in a love triangle between her high school teacher and a stoner classmate. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It kind of flip flops around. Like, the plot is all over the place. There's a serial killer, but there's a love triangle, and there's young love, and etc. I don't think the serial killer thing was AT ALL necessary, luckily it doesn't take a whole lot of time. When it settles down, it tackles a subject well enough but it needed tighter writing. The performances were good and the music was good, but the mish mash of stuff didn't always work. Still, it's entertaining.</quote>

Sometimes it works well, and there are some great laughs here. I don't care that it's by the books in every other way, because the blueprint works. I just wish it was more consistently funny, that's all. Still, surprising.</quote>

I don't even care about the story, I didn't really think the point was to tell an amazing one. I figure the point is to introduce badass characters (it succeeds) and put them into badass fights (well...). That's the problem, outside of the end, which has some beautiful scenery and fun action, the fights aren't that memorable. Still a fun movie.</quote>

There are some other story telling flaws but some plot points are decent enough. It also has good acting, some humour and when the movie cuts the shit and focuses on action, it does it quite well.

Yeah, fragments. But it lacks. However, I was never bored, and it was pretty thrilling, flaws aside. I have fun, what can I say? It's not great but it's entertainment.</quote>

  <summary>Two friends spend all their free time building flame-throwers and weapons of mass destruction in hopes that a global apocalypse will occur and clear the runway for their imaginary gang &quot;Mother Medusa&quot;. While waiting for the world to end, their call to excitement comes unexpectedly when one of them meets a charismatic young woman and falls hard in love. Quickly integrated into a new group of friends, they set off on a journey of betrayal, love, hate, infidelity and extreme violence. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The director is talented and it has pretty cool cinematography. Its creative and gives you something to think about. But the screen writing is sub-par and the acting is shaky. You have actors who are average most of the time but occasionally BELOW, delivering crappy lines and saying dude too much. So when the drama hits, it's like &quot;meh&quot; cuz it's so silly. Over the top to the point of stupid sometimes. With that said, it's still pretty entertaining, even if I think it doesn't all gel.</quote>

  <quote>Pretty solid indie noir. The good: pretty good visuals, decent acting , inspired Oldboy influenced (clearly) hallway brawl, chemistry between Jake and Sandy surprisingly nice, good fight scenes in other places as well. The bad: some parts are unintentionally bad, I thought maybe the movie was going for some comedy but I'm not really so sure now. I think maybe they failed when they were trying to be hardcore sometimes. But fun, moody film, mostly succeeds but doesn't blow minds.</quote>

Some of the action is good as well, but the movie just never really clicks like it should.

  <quote>Wouldn't say it says a lot to people who know a little bit about porn, but to those who don't it's probably more useful. This doesn't go into tremendous detail even though it's 2 hours, and sometimes the narrative is wonky. But with THAT said, it's very interesting hearing different sides tell how they feel, and the objectivity of the movie will lead to discussion. Also a good idea to allow Sasha Grey to talk a fair amount considering she's probably the most interesting girl in porn.</quote>

  <quote>Really, how often do you see a movie marketed as a romantic comedy also be about putting weapons in the sky?

Now, I can't speak for how accurately represented the culture is by any means, I think the script needed work (or perhaps just be left alone to breathe), and Aloha is by no means a GREAT movie, but I still enjoyed myself.</quote>

  <quote>Pretty great directorial effort going on here. The rural Midwest is made to look beautiful and horror-tinged at the same time, wonderful nature shots, creating an unsettling and foreboding atmosphere. Can't fault Hamilton, who interned for Malick and it shows. But the script is wonky; the mysterious figure on horseback adds zilch, the little girls' bro Martin is needlessly hostile from the beginning, and the internal logic is flaky, forcing drama. Comes across as too scripted, not organic.</quote>

I give horror movies that aren't just about haunted houses more recognition than maybe I should because I'm so sick of those types.

It doesn't reach its potential and loses some steam once it becomes very obvious which direction this is going. It's still a good time with some good scares and claustrophobia.</quote>

Sometimes the stylish transitions and quirks just didn't flow and some of the music choices just took me out of it.

  <summary>The Bad Boys Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are back together for one last ride in the highly anticipated Bad Boys for Life.</summary>
  <quote>Entertaining and I like who the villain ends up being. Lawrence and Smith still have chemistry, there's a few good jokes and the action is decent. It's an okay example of the action genre but doesn't reach any higher than that.</quote>

  <quote>It's fine all across the board but doesn't do a whole lot to separate itself in the coming-of-age genre. It's not as funny as some, nor as emotional as others; it exists in this in-between space where I can't think of anything substantial to criticize it about but I also can't think of anything to deride it for. Sure, it could be funnier since it's a comedy but it was still entertaining even if the laughs didn't always hit.</quote>

  <quote>While not written by the same writer as Suicide Squad, it suffers from some of the same issues, though not nearly as badly; most notably, Robbie is great as Quinn but the material just doesn't give her enough good stuff to work with. It comes across more as corny than anything else more than I would have liked. But it was still a fun enough film, just really insubstantial and unmemorable. Okay action, some decent jokes, underused secondary characters. Deserves better.</quote>

  <summary>Born Villain is a short film directed by actor Shia LaBeouf in collaboration with Marilyn Manson. It was released on August 28, 2011, during its inaugural screening, at the L.A. Silent Theater. Produced as an accompaniment to Marilyn Manson's eighth studio album, the film was intended as the record's promotional &amp;amp;quot;trailer&amp;amp;quot;. (Youtube)</summary>
  <quote>A mixture of Manson and Jodorowsky, clearly. While this doesn't really help lend Labeouf his own identity (just like Maniac didn't), it's still well done. It has odd, disturbing imagery, and it really isn't clear what's going on. Not really a fan of the Manson song... he's pretty much past his &amp;amp;quot;prime.&amp;amp;quot; But the video was well done and Shia's directed stuff seems more out there than the stuff he acts in, not that he isn't in some stuff with interesting ideas.</quote>

  <quote>The first act or so set up a nice little horror film with good atmosphere and a real sense of foreboding. There's a sense of surrealist style here that makes everything feel otherworldly but interesting. However, it gets worse from that point, and while never coming off the rails by any means, it ends up being a little more average/expected than it should have been. Decent acting, except for the masked man who not only has ridiculous dialogue but delivers it in a silly, over the top way.</quote>

There are some really inspired scenes, and the movie never bored me. I felt that some scenes were a little silly and I didn't really like the ending. But it does do a good job mostly at examining these characters. I flip flopped on 65 (pretty high end good) or 70 (very good). Some moments of weakness but all in all, good stuff.</quote>

  <quote>It's pretty good, nothing exceptional. Like others have said it loses its way in the final act with flashbacks, mostly because a) there's no tension in them and b) they aren't necessary. We got it without being explicitly shown. It's also predictable, trying a swerve fairly early on but then going back on track with what we expected. But despite my criticisms I'm not going to act like I didn't enjoy it because the premise is undoubtedly tragic and it's mostly handled well.</quote>

  <quote>I haven't read the books so I can't come at it from that angle. As just a movie it hits enough to be fine, but is flawed.

It's pretty thin, more depth would have been nice, especially with Roland and The Man in Black, but it's relatively stylish and entertaining. Everyone but the child were pretty good.</quote>

  <summary>Dawson City: Frozen Time, pieces together the bizarre true history of a collection of some 500 films dating from 1910s - 1920s, which were lost for over 50 years until being discovered buried in a sub-arctic swimming pool deep in the Yukon Territory, in Dawson City, located about 350 miles south of the Arctic Circle. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Music was really moody and complimentary towards the images on screen, the premise itself is extremely interesting, and seeing clips from some of these movies was interesting for the film nerds that would actually seek this out. Unfortunately, the way the info is presented (mostly in text) gets a little tedious and the story itself isn't told in the most effective and engaging way. It's unfortunate that I have to label this as a little boring because it should have been so neat.</quote>

  <summary>On a daredevil caving holiday six girls are trapped underground when an unexpected rock fall blocks their exit. Searching the maze of tunnels for a way out, they find themselves hunted by a race of fearless, hungry predators, once humanoid but now monstrously adapted to live in the dark and with murder and mayhem on their minds.  (20th Century Fox)</summary>
  <quote>While it does succeed on creating an claustrophobic environment for its characters to go crazy in, I just didn't find this movie all that scary or daring. Still, it's not a horrible movie so it gets a recommendation.</quote>

  <summary>Four young men and a young woman sit in boredom. She smokes while one strums a lute, one looks at a magazine, and two fiddle with string. The door opens and in comes a young man, cigarette between his lips, a swagger on his face. The young woman laughs. As the four young men continue disconnected activities, the other two become a couple. When the four realize something has changed, first they stare at the couple who have kissed and now are dancing slowly...</summary>

  <summary>Based on a story by M. Night Shyamalan and directed by the brothers Dowdle (Quarantine helmers Drew and John Eric), this edgy thriller is set in an elevator, where a group of passengers are trapped with none other than the king of the underworld. Luckily for them, a homicide detective (Chris Messina) is on board. Not so luckily: the cop has issues of his own, including a not-so-long-ago-kicked addiction to alcohol.</summary>

  <quote>I wish it had done more with the premise, and it really stretches the found footage concept, but I like the format when it's done right, and despite the fact that it feels very familiar in a lot of ways, I enjoyed it. There was some good imagery here, decent dialogue and sense of style. The final act in the tunnels felt very uninspired so that hurt it, but up until that point I had it at a 70 or a 75. Still worth a watch for horror buffs even if it's unoriginal.</quote>

  <quote>I'm torn. It's a technical achievement but I'm not sure it was worth it. Sometimes when he just moved the camera along a wall with talking placed over it the movie felt dull. And like someone said, the long shot at the end is impressive but also kinda just felt like a long shot. There are moments where it's gorgeous and the narrative would be interesting if it wasn't limited by Bi Gan's directorial choices. I liked it, ultimately, and admire it in ways but I wanted more.</quote>

  <quote>It's better than Interstellar by a little bit because it doesn't really have anything that annoyed me. But I think Nolan is starting to lose me. His directorial sense is strong here; it looks beautiful, everything is framed wonderfully, he makes the environment interesting even if it's mostly water. His usage of loud sounds and unconventional music is great, lends it a sense of dread. But I felt cold, it was dry, a little boring, very little heart and the performances were only ok.</quote>

  <quote>It was fun, but honestly the hardware store scene (where he never even picks up a gun) kinda got to me. I know it's nit-picky, but for some reason it bothered me. The attempt at &quot;original&quot; kills didn't have the same effect on me that it might have had on others. Still, Denzel is great, and it's always a little satisfying watching a movie like this. Stereotypical villains, slowmo explosions, lots of action... follows a formula, does it pretty okay.</quote>

  <quote>It's important to consider how Moore manipulates things in order to make his points. Usually he is entertaining and treats documentaries more as an angry call to arms than an even look at a situation. I'm okay with that, but this feels like a mess. There are times he's so right on, I learned some things, but then this felt so unconnected a lot of the time... or if it is, it's a very loose connection.

  <quote>A tale of two movies. One is a dull life of a kid (and his family) doing dull stuff like firing a slingshot and getting his eyes checked. It's so mundane that it hurts.

I do respect what Rosi has done, however, with excellent direction. Unlike other docs, there's nothing to really sway you; the distinct lack of music (unless naturally there) is important.</quote>

  <quote>Quite by the numbers. It'd be nice to see more rom-coms that try to innovate the genre but I mean, this kind of thing is what the main audience wants, not overly critical people like us. They want two people who should be together to get together. Cue some drama, and then it happens. Though I didn't find the movie funny and the drama was only okay. The acting was fine, the script brought up some nice issues about relationships. Ultimately forgettable but not bad in the least.</quote>

  <summary>This update of the 1985 horror comedy focuses more on terror than laughs when teen Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) suspects that his new neighbor, the sinister Jerry Dandrige (Colin Farrell), is a vampire, and turns to a self-styled vampire expert, Peter Vincent (David Tennant), for help. Las Vegas magician Vincent proves useless, and it's up to Charley to save his mom, Judy (Toni Collette), and girlfriend, Amy, from the seductive bloodsucker.</summary>
  <quote>Yeah, it's good. It's tongue-in-cheek in ways and I suppose that makes it a bit satirical, but it's still a vampire movie, which -- at this point -- takes a lot more to impress me. It's solid and a decent time, but really nothing more than that. Everything is competent, though I don't feel like it was that funny.</quote>

  <quote>Entertaining, murder mysteries are generally fun until they aren't. It all comes down to the resolution and this didn't have one that will blow minds exactly, but the execution of it as a whole is pretty solid; the electropop and moody atmosphere helps, certainly.</quote>

  <quote>Nah td888, you aren't the only one who enjoyed it. While Die Hard has certainly &quot;lost its way,&quot; and it is certainly illogical, I don't even care because it's a Hollywood action movie. Things blew up and Brucey murdered dudes. Yes, some of it is STUPID and I certainly mentally rolled my eyes (cuz rolling eyes physically is for losers!), I still ultimately had a good time. Die Hard will never be like the first few, but they don't have to be (tho it'd be nice). Just entertain me.</quote>

  <quote>It's fun, I don't see the glaring issues that others here seem to. I don't even think this was meant to be a horror movie. It certainly is set up like one and occasionally acts like one, but you can tell the director thinks it's a little silly and acts on that, leading to some upbeat montages and ridiculous deaths. My problem is that I don't think it went far enough into silly territory. It does everything... okay. Would have given it a 70 if the plot twist wasn't so predictable.</quote>

  <quote>Since metal isn't that represented it's always nice to see a movie about it. If you understand the clichés and tropes of metal then there are some good jokes here, but they are few and far between. It doesn't really hit satisfying emotional depths and since there isn't a lot of comedy to bail it out it ends up being a pretty fun but ultimately insubstantial little flick about a culture that your average person doesn't care to indulge in.</quote>

  <quote>Like many others I think the premise is really cool but this whole movie feels underdeveloped. It would have worked well as a TV show where they could have fleshed it out, or even a longer movie. Interesting ideas are in here, and I thought it was a 70 until the end when everything seemed to resolve too quickly. With that said, the end did have a fun action sequence in a hallway that felt fairly raw. But ultimately, it's a film that should have reached for more. Still entertaining.</quote>

Good performances by Wood and Lynskey, also a good sense of atmosphere and directorial prowess for Blair/the cinematographer.</quote>

  <quote>Watch Chloe's ghost eerily creep up on people who think they're having a private moment. Seriously though, it's very sappy.

There is some hokey stuff scattered throughout, and the spirit stuff is a little silly a times, but it's pretty good at what it does. Chloe is instantly likeable and god damn that crushing scene with Keach.</quote>

This movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scare tactics nearly as much as a lot of modern movies. It's not really that scary in general but it's an entertaining flick that has some OH HELL YES moments. A bit of surprise for me.</quote>

  <quote>I might as well be honest, I liked it, just like I enjoyed Olympus Has Fallen. The script sucks, though some of the humour worked, and most of the cast is misused (Butler is fine in this role). There's blatant xenophobia and Jingoism, but I'm more forgiving of that. Ultimately, it's just an action movie, and it takes more for action movies to leave me feeling like I wasted my time/money. It's fun and stupid, I had a good time.</quote>

Competently shot but unremarkable, I'm destined to be the contrarian with this one.</quote>

  <quote>Revenge stories are almost always fun, and the formula to get a decent one is simple. This hits that formula enough to entertain me but it is basic and brings nothing new to the table. The action sequences are okay but in the better examples of the genre they are more thrilling. The hard rock violence music is bad, and Garner tries but it's hard for me to believe her in that role. And yet despite the obvious flaws I was never bored and I'd watch the sequel.</quote>

  <quote>The best parts are when Brady interacts with his sister and his disabled friend Lane. They felt warm and authentic, sometimes sad. Zhao puts in completely solid work here on the directorial front, the cinematography and music/sound design are definitely stand-outs. But as Pratchett3 said, the untrained actors delivered lines poorly... too often to be able to brush off. Brady was decent in a first performance but there were a lot of times his inexperience showed, which crippled scenes.</quote>

  <summary>Despite his conviction that demonic possession is just so much supersitious mumbo jumbo, Catholic priest-in-training Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) journeys to Rome to attend a special exorcism school being taught at the Vatican. Before long, true-believer Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins) introduces the young cleric to the devil's power firsthand.</summary>
  <quote>I enjoyed the whole, dude is confused about his faith angle, and how other characters talk about it. The rest of the movie was solid in pretty much every way, though not anything extravagant and overly memorable. A horror flick that's at the high end of good but not very good. I also like seeing Ciarán Hinds.</quote>

  <quote>It's way too dark for a lot of it. Apparently not just my TV since others had the same issue. It's predictable, uses a lot of the same tropes that so many horror movies use, the cast was okay and the relationships were somewhat interesting, though very surface-level. However, still entertained it, like the woods as a setting regardless, and the monster was awesome. Some hokey parts, ending resolution was a little too simple, some dumb shit happens, but a decent horror flick.</quote>

  <quote>Admittedly I don't remember the original that much, and I'm sure that this tamed the original. But this isn't bad. It's a solid action movie that isn't that original. I don't really like Joel in the lead most of the time, but sometimes he was okay. The opening segment is intense and pretty awesome, and the social commentary is there, while not being overly militant. So, it was a good time but will I remember it years from now? Nope.</quote>

Besides, I see lots of people on the net looking into this as if it IS real, so that lends some mystique to the entire experience. It's not as creepy as I would have liked, however.

Most action movies are stupid, so I don't care if the action is silly sometimes because I'm going to this movie to see someone kick ass. There are no gaping plot holes that make it unforgivable, and it does a decent enough job giving Neeson a reason to be a badass. It's better than the second. The series is getting tired, but it's still mildly enjoyable. A pretty good action flick, ultimately.</quote>

Rest of movie - &quot;Cameo&quot; seriously hurts film, so weird-for-the-sake-of-weird . Rest of film is uneven. Tone shifts aren't done that well, comedy sometimes falls flat, becomes a little dull, horror doesn't work mostly, doesn't commit to anything. The end - oddly moving though, and definitely original.

A slow movie is fine but there's gotta be something there to grip you and sometimes Unbroken forgot that. Still decent, great story.</quote>

  <quote>Kate Beckinsale, vampires, werewolves, cool action scenes, pretty good visuals and atmosphere... check. But then I felt like the movie fucked me because the movie set up a sequel in the worst possible way ever... by lacking content. I mean c'mon, you were doing SO GOOD, add another half hour onto this short as hell movie and then I probably have no complaints. Entertaining but that really irked me. Still see it, though.</quote>

With assassins chasing him and the police unsympathetic to his story, Harris must reassemble his world piece by piece, helped only by the one person (Diane Kruger) who seems able to grasp his plight.</summary>
  <quote>While it was so easy to see the twist coming a mile away, I thought it was still a pretty thrilling er, thriller. Mind you, once the twist happens, it loses some steam, but up until then, it's tense and well made. Even afterwards, it's perfectly watchable, just not great.</quote>

  <quote>The Big Short rode kinetic energy successfully, this attempts something similar but just feels lesser. I enjoy the flourishes McKay puts into his storytelling, both narratively and visually, but I didn't connect as much to this one. Although the aim was slightly different, I didn't have as much fun watching it. Attempts at humour mostly failed. The performances are all really good, there are a few great scenes, and for the most part it was entertaining, albeit a little long for what it is.</quote>

  <quote>Unfocused and doesn't add a lot to the conversation. I know games, been playing for a long time so it doesn't tell me much. It's an entry-level documentary but tries to convince us that it's more. It's still pretty decent even if it jumps around way too much and juxtaposes things that shouldn't be. The tone is off because of this, and it's a little dry (especially when it's info-dumping) but like I said, it's a mildly entertaining watch.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoy the premise a lot because I like when movies have small situations like this. It forces clever writing and good acting in order to be good, and it's difficult to pull off. The direction is fine, the acting is fine, the script is a little wonky, it's a little boring at first but picks up eventually, the ending song is cringey. It isn't scary (it's not meant to be), but it feels a bit like a horror movie in its pacing and how things unfold, which is kinda neat. Entertaining, worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>Sometimes it moves too fast, sometimes you don't see things that you really should see, but when it actually settles down and tells its tale it can be fairly compelling stuff, especially since McConaughey is great here. The problem is that since there is so much average stuff in between the few scenes where it's allowed to breathe it has a hard time building momentum. I can't call it &quot;good&quot; but it's pretty close.</quote>

It gets some points though because I actually love graffiti so the fact we got to see some was pretty awesome.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoyed it, but as a big X-Men fan I (sadly) have to admit that I didn't outright love it. Definitely suffers from being more of the same in a lot of ways, and some parts were hammy. But at the same time, there were plenty of great scenes that make the filler ones forgivable. X-Men movies don't lack destruction, but rely less on fight scenes as a whole than the MCU, making them deeper and more substantial... like they have something to say. I've always admired that, still do here.</quote>

It doesn't really tell you a whole lot, in depth, but then I'm not sure what it could really tell you anyway. It goes out to show how marketers think, and I already believed that marketing is a misuse of intelligence (though arguably necessary in this fucked up society). I'm kind of ranting, sorry, the movie was decent, not great. Maybe a stepping stone to something more.</quote>

  <quote>Kind of expected more from it. There's some creepy dialogue and the movie has a definite dream-like feel so the insanity of it is pretty atmospheric for that reason. But I dunno. Looked cheesy at times which took me out of it a bit and failed to truly grip me and terrify me.</quote>

  <quote>It doesn't do a whole lot to separate itself from other war movies about Americans, which isn't meant to sound as dismissive as it does. I'm not one for Jingoism, nor am I pro-military... but I can still get behind a tale of heroism if it's told well. This is just kind of there, acted decently, shot competently, but with little to actually care about or say. Which is sad because the story itself is pretty extraordinary and would lend itself well to a movie.</quote>

  <summary>When the heir (Ryan Gosling) to a New York real estate fortune becomes entangled in the mystery surrounding the disappearance of his lover (Kirsten Dunst), he might lose everything in this drama set in the 1980s and inspired by the true story of real estate scion Robert Durst. While the detective on the case discovers unexpected evidence -- which turns up the political heat -- people with ties to the case begin to die.</summary>
  <quote>Thought that it built up really well to a certain point and then lost its way. It was so tightly edited and made, and then I just started wondering what the hell is going on? It was at this point that the movie lost like 20 points for me. It's sad really because Gosling did a great job, and I even liked Kirsten Dunst.</quote>

  <quote>This movie wasn't that bad. It didn't do anything especially well but it was entertaining and as long as they show Batmans' origins and show him brooding, USUALLY he's fun. The Joker was awful all around, some of the voice acting was sub-par and there were a couple scenes that made me cringe but this is yet another entertaining Batman flick. Worth one watch (I mean c'mon, Batman vs Dracula) but you'll never want to watch it again.</quote>

It has good voice acting all around, though some of the lines are wonky. The animation mostly works, but doesn't call much attention to itself. This isn't one of the best animated Batman movies, but it's still fun. The ending is fantastic.</quote>

  <quote>It does nothing original or even particularly interesting with a pretty cool premise (I like these kinds of movies), and it's quite predictable, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a decent time. Unlike a movie like Cube where characters question everything and that's part of the fun, this is really straightforward, which hurts it. The ending is shit. Seriously, the reveal has some of the worst reasoning ever; the results of the experiment would be so obvious to even stupid people.</quote>

  <quote>While the ending isn't amazing or anything, it's truthful, and for Hollywood flicks like this it's a nice change. Jennifer Aniston gives a solid performance, Vince is okay, but not quite up to par. But is this really a comedy? It felt more like a drama... really threw me for a loop, much like a movie like The Weather Man did. So once I adapted to it and took it more as just a drama, I enjoyed it more than I thought. The writing, direction, cinematography... all of it is okay but not great.</quote>

  <quote>Can't fault how it's shot or the performances, which are universally good/great but a tad overrated. My real beef is that it's boring, nothing happens, too simplistic, no real reason to care about these characters; in real life this internal struggle is enough by itself, in a movie it's hard to care if the characters aren't worth investing in. Some bad dialogue throughout, but the awesome speech at the end by Stuhlbarg was emotional despite the movie not earning it up to that point.</quote>

And that's the good part, I felt very emotional during it and that helps me forgive the fact that the rest of the movie is not memorable. But I have a hard time not recommending a movie that makes me feel this much, unless it feels manipulative... which this does not.</quote>

  <quote>Has subject matter that is more interesting than the movie. I've had the book for years and haven't read it so maybe I should do that because it would have more depth. This is a pretty decent spy/war drama that doesn't do enough character studying. Fantastic cast, my boy Rudd is killin' it as per usual, but the first hour or so is only mildly okay and it takes until the final act for it to have any real excitement or tension. A little disappointed here but still enjoyed it.</quote>

  <quote>I'm so conflicted. Like a lot of people, I was told how amazing the twist is. Because of events in my life, it just really isn't that surprising, and I can't see how it is to anybody with the net. It's a good movie up until the twist... it's interesting, kind of creepy at one point. After it, it loses a lot but is still decent. Ultimately the movie goes from probably what could have been an 80 to a 60. But expectations really killed this.. the twist is not that interesting. It's obvious.</quote>

Successively deprived of parents and homes and with few other ties, Ballard descends literally and figuratively to the level of a cave dweller as he falls deeper into crime and degradation.

  <quote>It's not really entertaining as it is a little uncomfortable because unless you're like me and hump corpses all day, then it's pretty hard to watch. Mostly we watch Ballad run through the woods with a gun, mumble incoherent sentences, occasionally murder someone and have sex with said corpses. It's pretty good at hitting a Southern Gothic feel, but it isn't the most thrilling watch. This works better in novel format, I believe.</quote>

  <quote>First off, I love Paul Rudd. I always enjoy watching him. He also delivered a great line at the beginning. I'm not really a fan of Zach G, I've learned. I expected a lot more due to the great beginning. But then it lost itself a bit, for a little too long. Then the dinner came and it was a great movie again.. it was a little too late to make me give this at least a 70, but these really really low reviews I'm seeing disappoint me, regardless.</quote>

  <quote>I still think these movies are entertaining and have no shame in saying I love the first, but it's hard not to feel like the novelty is wearing off a bit. They add more badasses, but the content gets more shallow and uninspired with each new entry. It's still fun because it's explosions, silly action and cheese, but it doesn't do any of that as well as the first. What was once funny isn't. Mindless entertainment, but there's better entertainment of this type out there, despite the ppl involved.</quote>

It's not going to blow your mind by any means, but as an interesting little take on the bank heist genre, it's really not bad.

  <quote>For whatever reason I had fairly high hopes. I actually like the idea of 4 assassins in a room talking. I feel like there can be a lot of great tension there, plus assassins are cool. However, this doesn't live up to its potential; with shady acting from 2 of the assassins, and weird reactions from certain characters that breaks the flow and makes me go CMON. It's not a bad movie if you're into this sort of thing though.</quote>

Not because of the weirdness, just because that for every weird moment, there was a couple not so fantastic moments. Oh well, original and twisted... worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>It's not a bad little mystery film that plays with something we've seen quite often. There are a few problems though. The movie takes way too long before it reveals much of anything, no scraps thrown to us, where it reveals every single thing at the end. Not the mark of a great mystery. Actors are okay usually but have some bad moments. Script needs tightening up, some characters are useless or just plain uninteresting. The ending doesn't hit home like it's supposed to.</quote>

  <summary>The haunted Lambert family seeks to uncover the mysterious childhood secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It does do a decent job of hitting atmosphere and the story is a little intriguing. It's definitely a step down (or 3) from the first one, which had its own problems but I rated close to an 80. The acting in this was downright terrible sometimes, and some of the cheese was a bad cheese since obviously the movie wasn't going for it.The music was too loud sometimes to try to be scary but I did enjoy the title screen for that, and it did feel like an old movie AT TIMES. At it's best its only okay.</quote>

  <quote>I give props to the soundtrack, the performances and the visuals. Also the science because I don't care if it's pseudo-science or accurate because fiction is allowed to take an idea that is based in reality and do fun things with it. I even enjoyed the plot twist. What I'm not into is how dull it can be, how it drags, the unnecessary shots that get in the way of the flow, and how it comes off like it's trying to say something but it's not really saying much. Also has terrible mixing.</quote>

  <summary>In The Interview, Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) run the popular celebrity tabloid TV show &quot;Skylark Tonight.&quot; When they discover that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show, they land an interview with him in an attempt to legitimize themselves as journalists. As Dave and Aaron prepare to travel to Pyongyang, their plans change when the CIA recruits them, perhaps the two least-qualified men imaginable, to assassinate Kim Jong-un. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It was okay. I found the very beginning with Eminem to be the highlight, and the rest of it was decent. At first you feel like you're watching something due to all the drama behind it but it does everything it can to quickly unravel that and show that it's just an average Rogan/Franco comedy. Their chemistry is great, and both of them have done much much better, but the Interview is still entertaining. A lot of the jokes feel juvenile which doesn't seem to fit this particular film.</quote>

  <quote>It's enjoyable and worth watching, mostly because the Guy Ritchie style is fascinating in context of the fantasy genre. Fantasy can be rather stuffy at times, so to see him employ his roots, snappy dialogue and clever editing to the genre was really cool. This is evident in some of the planning scenes. The action was decent, there were a few great scenes, some of it is a bit much, but my main criticism is that it's boring sometimes, which took me out of it a bunch of times. Good soundtrack too.</quote>

When the authorities catch on, she plans to abandon her crusade, only to be dragged in even deeper after a desperate plea for help from her sister. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The relationship between Ollie and Deb--along with the performance by Thompson--is enough to keep this interesting, but it never stakes its claim as anything more than a pretty decent little crime film. There's nothing especially memorable outside of said Thompson performance (which isn't even her career best by any means), and more could probably have happened, but I still enjoyed it.</quote>

  <summary>Debbie Ocean gathers a crew to attempt an impossible heist at New York City's yearly Met Gala.</summary>
  <quote>It's fine: a normal heist movie where things go exceptionally well and there are some good actresses in there. However, while the top actresses here are fantastic in other roles, and arguably better than their male counterparts from Eleven, I never felt that this cast had the magnetism/charm of the Oceans Eleven crew when together... I could watch the Eleven talk to each other all day, but here they just weren't cool enough to pull that off, which made this a tougher (but still decent) watch.</quote>

  <quote>Too quaint for its own good, ultimately. Redford was good, it embraces its simplistic storytelling and filmmaking, but it felt so inconsequential and insubstantial. Musical choices were clearly chosen to further the quaint agenda but I don't know, it felt like an unmemorable TV movie sometimes. I can't say that I hated it but my mind drifted more than I would have liked.</quote>

It's good from a technical standpoint but I never got as invested in these characters as the movie needed me to. It just puttered along; it flirted with something much more exciting but then it nipped that in the bud a little.</quote>

  <quote>On one end, the trailer didn't look good. But on the other end, it's fucking Nick Frost and Simon Pegg so I hoped for the best. I got a serviceable film, with a few laughs and nerdy references and whatnot, but this is not even close to the greatness of their other team ups. I felt like it actually relied way too much at some points on just being vulgar, which honestly, I don't find that amusing. When it settles down and crafts actual jokes, it's funny. Though I do like the &quot;three tits&quot; gag.</quote>

The one criticism I have is that while the first one (which is far superior) was long, it didn't FEEL long. This is actually shorter I think but it needed to be trimmed. If you tighten this up it's a lot more thrilling. I do like the water physics that the ghost hair has.</quote>

Script had a couple okay twists, but didn't go into enough detail and abandoned what made the movie good a bunch of times. The ending, meh, not fulfilling thematically or emotionally. However, I like the concept of the movie, with the battling between different types of psychics, just wish it would have been handled better.</quote>

It benefits from being about a character we've known for a while, so we can get inside his head and feel his inner conflict more. The action is okay, Stallone was decent though not nearly as inspired as he has been in Rocky. It's very brutal too which makes it stand out a bit. Yeah, this is kind of whatever and maybe I would have enjoyed it less if I wasn't a sucker for this premise.</quote>

Thematically, it makes all kinds of sense and I didn't see it coming. But to basically watch, what, half an hour or more of a movie and then have that twist kind of renders it null. I'm not sure a twist that lasts 5-10 minutes can make up for how stupid the last while of the movie got.</quote>

  <summary>John Shaft Jr., a cyber security expert with a degree from MIT, enlists his family's help to uncover the truth behind his best friend's untimely death.</summary>
  <quote>Like a few others have noticed, its cool that it doesn't seem especially concerned with being PC. Besides that it's not without its charm, but it's just passable. I was entertained most of the time because of the actors, but the material itself is not that endearing. They do what they can, they heighten this to an &quot;okay&quot; in my eyes, but it hardly impresses in any way. Pretty by the books average.</quote>

  <summary>After surviving the events of the first movie, Fin and April now face a new shark storm in New York City. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I think Sharknado is losing its c harm for me already. The first was a bit of fun but not as awesome as I would have liked... and this has a bigger budget and more cameos but it didn't do it for me even as much as the first. That could be just because the novelty is wearing off, or maybe it's just not as good. Or maybe this concept relies so heavily on the novelty that it's part of the quality. Yeah, probably that. Silly fun though, regardless.</quote>

  <summary>After the disappearence of 13-year-old Giuseppe, her classmate Luna goes on a lone quest to find him. Based on the true story of the kidnapping of a young boy, Giuseppe Di Matteo, ordered by a Sicilian Mafia boss in 1996.</summary>
  <quote>As a whole it's probably worth watching because the soundtrack is pretty great, it's shot well on all fronts, the performances are fine and it's an interesting story. When it comes together it's a much better movie, but admittedly it was a bit of a struggle to pay attention to this at times. It just plods along and doesn't do enough with its premise. The drama isn't dramatic enough, the crime isn't criminal enough and the fantasy is not fantastical enough, so it ends up feeling very slight.</quote>

  <quote>I give props to what Linklater was trying to accomplish here, and I enjoy some movies that lack a traditional narrative, but as Landstander so expertly put it: it's dull. I'm not bothered by the dialogue because he was trying to portray a certain thing, and some of it was interesting, but the drifting style only worked for a little while. Just a really hard movie to truly get into, despite how inventive it is.</quote>

  <quote>The positives and negatives balance each other out and you're left with a movie that's the very definition of okay. The negatives being sometimes the tonal shifts from comedy to thriller/drama don't work, and some of the musical choices are poor. The positives being Wahlberg excels in these types of roles and while the story and action is predictable, it's ultimately okay enough to get some enjoyment from this.</quote>

Taken 2 stretches the boundaries of what's okay with movie logic, to the point that is there really a struggle? Everything is pretty easy for him, and the villains are dipshits. This suffers from familiarity as well, a sequel that does very little different than the first but not as well either. But I do like the premise.</quote>

  <quote>Well, it's certainly not an astonishing display of direction but it's a comedy so as long as it's funny it's worth seeing. Is it funny? Well, sometimes.

I don't really buy into whatever drama is in this movie and as a coming of age tale it doesn't work. The acting fairly horrible but it makes the funny parts funnier.</quote>

  <quote>Pretty typical indie fare. Terri is having problems with his life, gets to know someone who helps him through, all while being a dramedy. There's nothing special here but there's nothing truly awful either. What these types of movies need to do most of the time -- for me, at least -- is have a few really funny moments (this had minor chuckles here and there) and some really emotional parts (nothing really got me that much). So hence, it's pretty good, not very good or great.</quote>

  <quote>An okay movie in almost all ways. The only place it shines is in the casting because most of them are charming (I love Tina Fey).

It does it pretty well, but with a lesser cast it may not have worked because some of the script is wonky. It's also not actually that funny. I chuckled a couple times.</quote>

  <quote>It's an art world take on a familiar horror story; something is haunted, kills people. I like Gilroy's direction although it is hardly Nightcrawler level here, and Gyllenhaal puts in an early candidate for one of the better performances of the year, or at least one to consider a nomination for, as he plays oddballs really well. There are some deaths that are neat, but it's pretty slow and doesn't build tension well. Just a very conventional movie once you get past the glitz of fine art.</quote>

Sure, not a good movie, but worth watching.</quote>

  <summary>An absurdist war story for our times, writer-director David Michôd (Animal Kingdom) recreates a U.S. General's roller-coaster rise and fall as part reality, part savage parody - raising the specter of just where the line between them lies today. His is an exploration of a born leader's ultra-confident march right into the dark heart of folly.</summary>
  <quote>It's decent and interesting but falls flat in some ways. Doesn't have a whole lot of life to it, nor is it that funny for something that is supposed to be a dramedy. But still worth a watch if you want something that subverts some war movie conventions.</quote>

  <quote>It's not that bad. It's a TV movie with very little budget, so the expectations of certain elements are lower. It's a pretty entertaining movie, obviously the visuals aren't great but they're pretty good with what they had. It doesn't do anything overly cool and some parts look more low budget than others. Acting was poor to good, depending. The script needed work, that's unforgivable, and the ending was awful. Had it succeeded in the writing I would have given it a much higher rating.</quote>

  <quote>I give it some extra points because of an interesting premise. As I've said in some other reviews, we should be easier on certain movies for that reason. Not saying it's exempt from criticism or anything, because as my 59 says, this isn't a great or even good movie. It's serviceable, and it's mostly fun. It's bogged down by some tedium and silliness on occasion, and doesn't have any amazing moments but it's entertaining most of the way. The interesting premise takes it up a few points.</quote>

  <quote>It's not a terrible movie though it drags a bit here and there. The opening few seconds is intense, but then the narration right after is kinda cheesy. After that you have a decent but not great movie, though I really didn't like Jaden's acting at times. The movie looks nice, and everything is staged well. I maintain that Shyamalan is a talented director, and this is a step in the right direction to get his career back on track. It's really not as bad as people are saying.</quote>

  <quote>I can appreciate the effort here, and while it's obvious it was all done with green screen, the effects themselves aren't awful, especially given the budget. It's still painfully noticeable and that may bother people. The acting is average to good most of the time, the script/plot needs work. Really, they should have focused more on just giving this a great story, great characters, then everything else would be more forgiveable, because story is one thing you don't need a budget for.</quote>

  <summary>Lindsay Anderson and Shelagh Delaney's The White Bus is a surrealistic film about a secretary who takes a strange trip, part of which takes place on the eponymous vehicle. The nameless girl has a seemingly dull life, which is interrupted by periodic flights of fantasy involving suicide, recreations of paintings, and pieces of meat that suddenly run blood-run. (Fandango.com)</summary>
  <quote>I actually thought it was pretty dull a lot of the time. However, there were a few scenes that helped push this past a 50 for me, namely the end, and a couple little laughs here and there (like at the very beginning). Visually it's interesting, I mean, a 1967 movie that mixed colour and B&amp;amp;W footage was a nice touch. Hell, that's a nice touch even today. I'm not sure what the movie meant but like I said, there were some good scenes, though I wouldn't give it a strong recommendation.</quote>

Aside from that, an okay horror flick; not astounding nor original, uses the same tactics as others, has some cool scenes. They thought that the doll was creepier than it is.</quote>

But the crazy premise does lead to some entertaining scenes, and if you're going to an exploitation flick you just want to see a lot of sexual and gruesome shit, which this has. Decent attempt but not noteworthy.</quote>

  <summary>Batman and Nightwing are forced to team with the Joker's sometimes-girlfriend Harley Quinn to stop a global threat brought about by Poison Ivy and Jason Woodrue, the Floronic Man. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I think in the grand scheme of things I kinda liked it. Admittedly, some of the jokes got me, and while I prefer darker Batman, this did a relatively decent job being lighter. It's just that they throw a lot of jokes out there and most don't work. What was going on with the part in the hangout with all the villains? Jesus that was silly. Harley's voice artist was not good.</quote>

  <summary>Three high school virgins, suspended from school on a bogus graffiti charge, flee to the inner city in an attempt to live out the plot of The Catcher in the Rye... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I enjoy the premise quite a bit, and there is undeniably some amusing parts in this where the vulgarity and satire work well together. Unfortunately there's too much where it just doesn't, where it becomes unfunny and boring. It gets a pass on the premise and the funny parts here and there, and the acting is okay, but don't rush out to see this. If you want to see an indie flick that's not horrible, and fairly original within the genre, check it out though. Very mild recommendation here.</quote>

  <summary>An undercover cop tries to take down a ruthless crime lord with access to a neutron bomb by infiltrating his gang. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's one of those &quot;nothin' better to do on a slow day&quot; kinda movies, meaning, if you want to just kill an hour and a half with something that isn't really that good but still ends up being mildly entertaining... then this is a movie you can go to. The plot is silly, with how a drug lord ends up becoming the hope for the people, but the parkour-action scenes are pretty decent and while it doesn't work real well, it works enough to be a bit of fun. You have to ignore the many shortcomings though.</quote>

  <quote>I can say I enjoyed it but most of that was because I was waiting for the story to expand and be more than superhero torture porn. I figured something neat would happen. The premise is great, and admittedly if this happened in real life this is what would happen, but this still could have been executed better. Where's the actual plot exactly? What Warren said is true: there's a lot to dig into but it doesn't really do any of it.</quote>

  <quote>It's fine, passable if you want a revenge/vigilante flick to pass some time. Roth doesn't bring any real flair to make this stand out among all the other films of this ilk, but I enjoyed it. My problem is mostly with critical reception: they say it's thoughtless but it riffed on how easy it is to get a gun, how useless police are and if vigilantism is good or not. This stuff is hardly revelatory but it made me wonder if the critics and I watched the same movie.</quote>

  <quote>I like Woodley a lot even though I felt she was a little misplaced in this role. Maybe I just have a hard time separating her from her EXCELLENT performance in Spectacular Now. She's talented and makes it more watchable than it should be. Aside from that, it's a pretty generic dystopian YA movie. Decent idea, decent talking point, but nothing really sticks out and the end was a little anti-climatic (JUMPING ON A TRAIN). Actions scenes were uninspired. Fear drug scenes were okay. Average flick.</quote>

Social commentary is meh, but at least it's there I suppose. It was entertaining and I guess that's what matters, but it could have been a lot more.</quote>

I kinda wish they would do this film now with different people because there's a great movie buried underneath the silliness (hulk dogs) and gimmicky comic book panelling. The attempt at making a more psychological comic book movie is ambitious and could be good, but it's really dull here. It just plods along. Action is mostly lame, but occasionally decent. More interesting as an experiment.</quote>

Don't get me wrong, it uses the black and white with some colour thing really poorly, and would have been a stronger film without it, but if you can forgive its flaws and that it never reaches a high level... like I said, it's okay.</quote>

  <quote>The core concept is neat enough, but it's not done especially well. Most of it is seen in first-person perspective, which is still a novelty in film, so until it becomes used more it gives scenes a more unique look, much like a first-person shooter. The gamer in me likes how the action unfolds in that view, but I also found that the acting seemed more stunted in that view, not that it was great to begin with; good, but nothing more. An okay sci-fi flick to pass some time.</quote>

  <summary>An everyday guy decides to take justice into his own hands after a plea bargain sets his family's killers free. His target: The district attorney who orchestrated the deal. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It was pretty decent until it got to the explanation of who's doing what and how. Won't ruin it but it's ridiculous in a bad way. That, and the ending, is just crap and knocks a 75 down to a 55. You cheer for him at the beginning and then you get a lot of gray area and then he's a bit of a knob than he's an asshole. And yet he still doesn't work as a great villain. A very minor recommendation because it's not a complete waste of time.</quote>

  <summary>The Mediterranean summer: blue sea, blazing sun....and 250 kg of gold stolen by Rhino and his gang! They had found the perfect hideout: an abandoned and remote hamlet now taken over by a woman artist in search for inspiration. Unfortunately surprise guests and two cops compromise their plan: the heavenly place where wild happenings and orgies used to take place turns into a gruesome battlefield.</summary>
  <quote>I'm a champion of &quot;style over substance&quot; if the style is awesome but this was roughly 75% &quot;just trying to complicate matters&quot; style and 25% legitimately interesting imagery. Scenes with the golden woman, the man walking through burning ashes; good stuff. Excessive close-ups, repetitiveness, the final bunch of the movie covered in darkness (and more close-ups), odd inclusion of certain scenes; bad stuff. An okay story with okay violence, smothered by mostly ineffective stylistic choices.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoyed it enough to give it a mild recommendation but that's about it. It's not that good, really, but it was entertaining somewhat. Mewes puts in pretty okay work all-in-all, the premise is kind of fun. There's not as many jokes as I would have thought, and there is a scene in there that is pretty emotional. I can understand if people don't like this but it was mediocre at least.</quote>

Before long, an elite force of mercenaries assault the prison in search of the new arrivals. As the true identities of the women are revealed, Steele realizes he's caught in the middle of something far bigger than he had imagined. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I'm not going to try to pass this off as anything more than what it is... it's an alright action movie that I figure people on here will end up hating. I kind of dug it. I mean, Seagal is really old, and some of the dialogue is just bad, and the action scenes do nothing that hasn't been seen a million times before. But I liked it. Also, I just like Stone Cold.</quote>

I suppose there's always something better to watch but this is breezy with enough twists to remain relatively interesting. Gina Rodriguez was pretty good. She survives this but the movie really sets her up as more than she is by the end. I wish I had seen the original since it seemed to have more oomph and importance to it.</quote>

  <quote>As Kasper said, some good imagery. Meth played a decent weirdo, but some of the acting (and writing...) was wonky. The musical choices were cool, as they didn't rely just on rap because Meth is in it, but instead they picked some downright folky, moody music for most of it. The ending wrapped up in an anti-climatic, predictable way and was too abrupt. They could have done more with the idea, but I still enjoyed myself despite the average story and whatnot.</quote>

  <quote>There are boring parts, but it's generally a fairly entertaining movie. There's always a bit of horror in a movie where people are trapped in space because it's hard not to project yourself into that situation, and the movie briefly wrestles with its own moral dilemma. Unfortunately, while I don't think it's necessarily sexist, it gives people ammo to think so, and they have material to justify it... which is problematic, obviously. Ultimately it's a kinda pretty, decent, shallow movie.</quote>

Sometimes the superpowers feel appropriate but then other times there's no real crunch to them. Tonal shifts between something a little darker (a struggle of h is daughter to protect what she loves) and silliness was a little off-putting.

Deathstroke is a badass... only he isn't in the movie. Spoilers, but, am I alone in wanting an epic Batman/Deathstroke confrontation instead of a little Batman/Deathstroke? I just don't buy that he beats some of these people. Deathstroke is forgettable and that's a shame.</quote>

  <summary>A glittery signal from the most ridiculous corners of the galaxy. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Name made me chuckle. The actors strike a nice balance between enjoying themselves and putting in good work (relatively speaking, considering the intent here). It's not that they're good, it's just that it's hammy but serious about being stupid, rather than intentionally terrible (and lazy). Not a bad premise but some of the shorts don't hit. I did laugh a few times, the parts in between the shorts are probably the most amusing. A minor pass, shorts could be trimmed.</quote>

I actually enjoy the final moments, but leading up to that, poorly played. The first was kinda scary but this wasn't, though I still enjoy people creeping around in masks.</quote>

  <quote>The name of the movie legit made me chuckle multiple times. The movie itself is a little boring and doesn't explore anything in that much detail. I suppose as just a romance movie with an odd premise it functions well and I should give some props, but I can't say I enjoyed a whole lot. Kind of cheesy, especially in the flash backs, and they really hammer that home with the choice of music a lot of the time.</quote>

Basically the movie is hit and miss in a lot of ways. It's not bad, it's pretty decent, but don't rush to see it. And proceed with caution if you do.</quote>

  <quote>I know it's an indie movie, that's why I forgive the CGI. In fact, I actually liked some of the undead/servant designs. That isn't really what got me about this flick. When you know the CGI isn't going to be great, you need to work on the plot/story/script. There's a great, interesting idea buried here, underneath awful writing (really should have said more about the characters and the story in general), and really poor acting. Also, the fight choreography was mostly stupid. Still see it tho.</quote>

  <quote>Statham is enjoyable. He pretty much always is, even if sometimes his choice in post-Guy Ritchie movies leaves a lot to be desired. I enjoy watching him as an action hero, but there just isn't much in Parker to thrill you. It's not bad, it's just not overly good. It takes a while to get exciting, and the stuff when it's not is okay. It's just a lot of meh.</quote>

  <quote>It wasn't awful. It was pretty entertaining the whole way through, but not a good movie. Kind of decent in every way, but if you  just need an hour and a half killed, this isn't a bad (or good) way to do.

  <quote>The acting is okay most of the time, but sometimes poor. This movie suffers from awful 'movie logic.' You know the kind... characters doing stupid shit just to make it 'scarier.' I understand a lot of horrors have this, but TBH relies too much on it. However, I think the villain guy was pretty decent, and the interesting idea of the girl being kind of the 'real' villain was nice. It had a decent atmosphere, some nice claustrophobia since it all takes place mostly in the house.</quote>

I enjoyed this enough to say people should give it a go. It's light fantasy, but it's not without it's charm.

  <quote>Yes, a recommendation, although very slight. We won't kid ourselves and say this is a great movie. But it's worth a watch if you have nothing better to do. Maybe the next one will be an actual good movie instead of not just a waste of time. This had fewer wonky moments than Twilight, the acting was kinda crap but I was actually involved at some points. So at least the series is improving.</quote>

  <summary>A band of kids embark on an epic quest to thwart a medieval menace. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>As this went on it seemed to lose the ingenuity that Cornish demonstrated so well in Attack the Block.  Putting kids in outrageous situations seems to be his thing, but AtB did so with more excitement and humour along with being more unpredictable. This started as a clever kids movie and degenerated into a very basic, lackluster fantasy flick with kids in it. I'm sure less critical eyes (kids) could get something out of this but I can't say that I really enjoyed it after a certain point.</quote>

  <quote>Malick has been one of the best directors that I consistently find a little tedious. I have yet to love any of his movies, but respect the fuck out of him. Here we have unconventional editing, short scenes, and an observational and drifting style that is the very definition of &quot;artistic.&quot; This looks wondrous, and yet this is a slog too. It could have been a lot shorter, and watching Bale mope around is not enthralling. Very shallow but pretty, and not in an engaging way.</quote>

  <summary>In a world ravaged by the Fire nation's aggression toward the peaceful Air, Water and Earth nations, reluctant youth Aang (Noah Ringer) learns that he's an Avatar -- a rare being who can manipulate all four elements and restore peace to the planet. Now Aang must join with his pal Katara (Nicola Peltz) and other allies to fulfill his destiny. M. Night Shyamalan directs this live-action adaptation of the animated series &quot;Avatar: The Last Airbender.&quot;</summary>
  <quote>I don't know shit about the source material. I watched maybe 10 minutes of an episode once, so going in I wanted some action and bending elements. The action can be a bit hit and miss, when it's good it's great though. The acting is pretty poor, the CGI is great, the script is average. Some of the editing is awful, like, there are times where it's just not cohesive at all. Seeing the show would have probably made me hate this, but as it stands now, I don't. I also don't recommend it.</quote>

  <summary>Giant mutant rabbits terrorize the southwest!! (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Imagine taking a comic-horror novel about mutated rabbits but then dropping the humour. That's what this is. As a bunny owner I can prove 100% that there is no way to make bunbuns scary. When they yawn, that's as close as it gets. In its defense I actually think everybody really tried to make something good here. There were some pretty good shots, it was mostly competent, but the premise is so flawed it can't work as a straight horror. Points for the cuties everywhere. LOOK AT THOSE FACES!</quote>

If you can seperate yourself from how dull it is, and appreciate the imagery it's probably worth a watch at least once.</quote>

I don't recommend it but it does have a few good laughs. Too few and far between, however. Also not a huge Zach or Will fan for what it's worth.</quote>

  <summary>Owen Wilson stars as a married man whose spouse (Jenna Fischer) grants him the right -- for just one week -- to pursue as many extramarital affairs as he can. His best buddy (Jason Sudeikis) receives an identical &quot;hall pass&quot; from his wife, and off the guys go. The hubbies soon discover, however, that picking up girls isn't as easy as they recall, while their better halves embark on their own erotic adventures.</summary>
  <quote>Not quite a recommendation. The jokes don't work nearly as often as they should, it's cliche, blah blah blah, and it's only mildly entertaining, but it's not even mildly entertaining all the time. There are tits and attractive women, though.</quote>

  <quote>Really disappointed. I expected good things considering the talent involved. The movie gets props for trying to do something a tad different than the normal action-thriller, but I felt like a lot of it didn't work. The chases were lame, I didn't feel the music fit the atmosphere and even the MMA type fight scenes didn't have the energy they should have. Mediocre acting and script as well. It had the makings of something amazing buried in there but failed.</quote>

  <quote>Train MMA for 3 or 4 days and you will be awesome! They take real MMA stuff and then add typical movie martial arts to it. I don't even mind that, it's nice seeing some basis in MMA reality. Acting is bad, the movie is more serious. The first had cool music and was pretty people havin' a good time with the whole production, this didn't feel like that, and it didn't do what it did real well. And they seem to just namedrop MMA things in order to be seen as 'legit.' At least Machida is in it.</quote>

  <quote>There are some unforgivable moments when a normal girl has superpowers, and it's almost completely by the books. At the same time, sometimes it's pretty inspired (mostly when it just sticks to making her creepy). I guess ultimately, even though I feel that they did a decent enough job making her creepy, I can't give this a recommendation based on the fact it makes you feel &quot;meh.&quot; It doesn't thrill because it's predictable, it doesn't make you feel and it's mostly generic (few scenes excluded).</quote>

  <quote>It's not a recommendation from me but it's not awful. It's just really shallow... I don't know why people are saying it's deep at all. Any movie can throw out an idea and not explore it with any depth. This would be forgivable if I felt there was some great quality, like an interesting story. There isn't. It plods along, generally being decent, never being amazing. Damon and Blunt are good (they're the highlight though I wouldn't say they're dazzling the audience), but the movie just falls flat.</quote>

  <quote>It's not really that I hated the movie, I just don't think you need to see it. Some of the disaster scenes are beautiful and, dare I say, gripping, but at some point you stop caring. I get that it's a disaster flick and it achieves that, with a little bit of emotion and John Cusack, but it's just so typical I don't see the point. It also drags at the beginning and the end... so the middle is pretty much what gives this a 45. And stop using these stupid cliches.</quote>

  <quote>I'm disappointed. While at times it's pretty clever, it's a lot crammed into one movie and it doesn't satisfy on any of the accounts. The way it wraps up is the worst offender; it explains the twist and then keeps going and going and going. It tries for some emotional depth and doesn't get it. I almost gave it a passing grade because it's harmless sci-fi, but then as I wrote this I realized that I don't think I actually enjoyed it.</quote>

  <quote>Not enough space on Criticker to discuss the message, but even though I can appreciate militant methods (like the Purge), this is... questionable, to say the least. Anyway, as a movie it's not what it could be. The premise is silly but it could have worked, we could have had fun with this and had badass chicks but the final act falls seriously flat. The rest of it is okay, very stylish and energetic, probably helped me forgive its shortcomings to some degree, and yet I can't quite recommend it.</quote>

  <quote>It's not atrocious. The first half or so is a fairly decent drama with some emotional oomph, even if it's a little hokey.

Certain elements are ignored, it gets a little silly, but there's no &quot;maudlin twist&quot; as RT states. I'm seeing a slightly different movie tonally then others, but I still don't think it's a good movie. Cut the second half and it may be okay.</quote>

  <quote>Criticker says I'd give this a 0 but damn it's not that bad. In fact, it's not really bad, it's just not recommended. There are better movies to watch. It kind of reminds me of Saw but in a car... meaning when the twist comes around it's kind of like Jigsaws intentions in Saw, if you think about it. Selena Gomez is lovely, Ethan Hawke was fine, and there were some decent moments here and there, but it really just didn't feel like it had a lot of life most of the time and felt a lil silly.</quote>

  <quote>Not the worst movie by any means, and the fact there's tits helps the (straight) guys out. But really this isn't funny in the least. There's like one or two moments where I sort of chuckled. I have been watching a bunch of these raunchy comedies over the past couple years and they just aren't amusing me that often. It's like, HEY LET'S SAY WHAT TEA-BAGGING IS AND IT'LL BE FUNNY! It's not. It might help if I actually got shocked into laughing but I just don't.</quote>

  <quote>I adore the movies I've seen from Carax (Mauvais Sang and Holy Motors), and I have every intention of visiting more of his filmography, but what? I mean, it starts out with a naked girl which is probably 40 points of this, but this is really just a very miniscule, uninteresting short. Carax can be pretty odd but this isn't appealing odd... listening to the short conversation between The Thinker and the girl isn't that amusing but I think it wanted to be (or philosophical).</quote>

  <quote>The Coens have this issue where they have a great setup with quirky characters and an intelligent script, and yet they leave me feeling really cold sometimes. This is one of those cases: HC is not terrible, but it failed as a comedy and while I think the premise is fine, the direction is solid and the love of the '50s shines, I just couldn't care about what was going on. The offbeat tone suffocates it and becomes awkward, and it's like they can't strike the balance.</quote>

It's not the worst thing to watch if you're bored but I still wouldn't recommend it because it just felt so inconsequential.</quote>

  <quote>Generally an okay action movie gets a passing grade from me because I'm easier on the genre and find a lot of them to be an entertaining way to pass the time, even if they're insubstantial. This follows all of the formulaic elements that the genre is known for, but I didn't ever feel like the world was at risk. I know, there was no way that Earth didn't win, and there's a lot of disaster but it didn't feel it ultimately. That makes it hard to forgive the wonkiness in other areas.</quote>

I like cool heist flicks but Soderbergh himself has done this genre better before. Still, good cast, they do what they can, it's just mostly boring.</quote>

The ending was stupid, but this isn't the worst romantic movie I've ever seen. 45 places it in a &quot;close but no cigar&quot; type of category.</quote>

Cosmopolis did that too but I was more into it and enjoyed it quite a bit, but the detached dialogue, the sometimes stiff acting and general weirdness didn't do it for me this time around.

Lost interest many times but still appreciate how unwavering it is in what it wants to explore. Problematic feminist issues are present; not offended, it was just awfully simplistic.</quote>

Every other element is okay but whatever, I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you're a Conjuringverse fanatic, which I'm not.</quote>

  <summary>When a young boy accidentally triggers the universe's most lethal hunters' return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race.</summary>
  <quote>Having only seen the first Predator this is extremely at odds with what I want. There are some good laughs, a few good deaths but then what else? It's incredibly generic and lifeless, the mixture of horror/comedy/action didn't work because nothing felt menacing. Predator managed drama along with some badass moments and good direction, this felt so painfully average. It was a waste of the Predator itself. Slipped into tedium a little too often to even give a minor recommendation.</quote>

  <summary>A retired assassin is drawn back into the life he gave up when his daughter is kidnapped. To rescue her, he must confront his former rival. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's not terrible, just a little dull and uninspired. The shoot outs really aren't that exciting at all, and many will say it's a lesser 'Taken' (it is), but it's not without its good parts. Cusack/Willis r underused but r seemingly just phoning it in anyway. It's a nice touch that the main character actually goes and buys bullets.. it shows some attention to detail that quite a few movies lack. But there's no oomph to anything. The final shootout isn't thrilling and the last showdown is stupid.</quote>

  <summary>In Justine's family everyone is a vet and a vegetarian. At 16, she's a gifted teen ready to take on her first year in vet school, where her older sister also studies. There, she gets no time to settle: hazing starts right away. Justine is forced to eat raw meat for the first time in her life. Unexpected consequences emerge as her true self begins to emerge. (Cannes2016)</summary>
  <quote>Not as gross as you'll think it's going to be going in, which is actually okay with me because I'm not a gore hound. I almost gave this a passing grade but I can't because while I think Marillier is fine in her role, the film feels dishonest; there were times where they just put Justine in contrived situations to further her cannibalistic tendencies. Some of them were cheesy, and the coming-of-age aspects were sub-par. There were good parts scattered throughout, but I felt cold. Fake depth.</quote>

  <summary>This spooky reimagining of the classic dark-woods folk tale stars Amanda Seyfried as Valerie, a village girl who's confronting a tumultuous romantic situation when a legendary werewolf slaughters her sister. Valerie enlists the help of a veteran demon hunter (Gary Oldman) to destroy the creature, but as each cycle of the moon brings fresh deaths, Valerie begins to realize that the murderous beast may be closer to her than she'd ever dreamed.</summary>
  <quote>I thought it was better than expected, up until a certain point, and then it just became stupid and shitty. Honestly, quite a bit of it is pretty decent, with good art design, and decent performances. Sometimes the script is wonky, but that's forgivable in the beginning. But then maybe the last half hour or a little bit more, the movie tanks really badly and I just can't bring myself to recommend it. It ends up not satisfying you.</quote>

(imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A comedy horror that isn't really that scary but is dark and comedic. It focuses a lot on arms manufacturers and is set up like a slasher flick. So you get really absurd shit going on because that's what you expect from the genre. It does twist a few cliches on their head like naked (or at least half naked) chicks not dying. I liked it but I won't recommend it. But it comes close.</quote>

  <summary>An orphaned teenager forms an unlikely friendship with a detective. Together they investigate her mother's murder, and uncover the supernatural force that proves to be a threat to her family.</summary>
  <quote>The premise is pretty neat. With that said it's a disappointment because it deserves a better movie than it is. Most things are okay, I suppose, but there's some wonky dialogue and acting here and there. It takes a while to get going which means you're watching a character study only the characters aren't especially interesting. It's also very very dark: just put some light on! The washed out palette does it no favours and doesn't create a compelling atmosphere.</quote>

  <summary>Ray Liotta (Goodfellas) delivers an intense, electrifying performance in this explosive follow-up to the gritty urban crime thriller Street Kings. Liotta plays Detroit detective Marty Kingston, the leader of an undercover narcotics team, whose members are being systematically murdered one by one. To solve the brutal killings, Kingston joins forces with a cocky, young homicide detective. But neither of them is prepared for the shocking corruption their investigation will uncover -- stunning secret (dvdactive.com)</summary>
  <quote>It's just really uninspired. I actually liked the first one (not a lot but still). This is just not as good, but Ray Liotta gives another fine -- even though he's on autopilot... he's just a master of this kind of role -- performance. I won't recommend it because it's generic, the twists are obvious, and it doesn't do anything real well, but it's also not complete dogshit, so if you do go against what I say and rent it... I'm man enough to admit you might just enjoy it, all things considered.</quote>

  <quote>I wrestled with myself about whether I'd give this a minor pass or fail. I'm going with fail because it's forgettable to the point that it's not worth seeing. That doesn't mean it's bad because it isn't, it's a fairly okay decent average crime movie that doesn't bring anything new or refreshing to the table while also not doing anything that well either.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoy the first, this is a mess. I still have an intrinsic adoration for the mutants so merely seeing them on screen makes me a little happy, but there's too much crammed in here and it's not satisfying enough. The action is still pretty fun but this is a lot more hammy; everybody is corning it up and it becomes too much. I enjoy when the Turtles crack lame jokes but nobody else works... it's just not as funny as the first one. Wasted potential because so many iconic characters are present.</quote>

  <quote>It tries to parody rom-coms but it just doesn't do a good job, ultimately. It sucks because I love seeing Rudd because he's charming as shit. I hate seeing him be in crap. It's almost a little too winky-winky to be that funny, and honestly, a lot of the more over-the-top shit doesn't work, like the dreadful part about wanting to fuck his grandma. It keeps piling up joke after joke that mostly don't work (though I chuckled a couple times) and doesn't really build a compelling narrative. Shallow.</quote>

Unfortunately, the ideas are squandered, as is the world that's built. A particular cool trailer moment is actually boring in the movie.  The leads a) suck and b) have no chemistry; huge miscasting. It's too long for what it is, scenes drag and are too hamfisted. Biggest problem is that it's just not fun.</quote>

  <quote>It wasn't terrible but not really worth a watch, the type of movie I'll only watch at this time of the year where this is nothing else that I can watch at home. Willis looks bored when he is on screen, which isn't often, and this hits all the beats that you would expect. Admittedly, at the beginning the dialogue and situations are hokey but they do become bearable.</quote>

  <quote>Isn't really a lot to write home about but I wouldn't go and say it's awful. I think what jhmclellan says is true, &quot;movie is forgettable.&quot; It doesn't really do anything. It tries to tell a heart-warming story of love and I suppose it does, but the idea is kind of silly. The main character is kinda wonky. No real scenes stick out, and you know what's going to happen. We've seen it a million times, and we've seen it done better. But still not awful, just not worth seeing.</quote>

  <quote>It's better than I expected but I still didn't like it. It started off promising, though. I thought this might be a surprise comedy for me judging by the first 20 minutes or so, but then it starts to fail both as a comedy and when it's trying to be a drama/action movie. The jokes (some of which are reused) end up overstaying their welcome or just aren't funny, and I didn't care enough about anything going on. Efron sucks but the Rock is still charming as always.</quote>

  <quote>I can get behind the message: I've ranted that amazing flicks make no money. But, why would you pick The Lion King? First of all, it's an incredible movie. Second, it's a kids movie that adults can enjoy so of course it'll stomp over everything. It's like, this flick has its heart in the right place but goes about it the wrong way. Not really an easy thing to explore in a few minutes, and the movie is too shallow and misguided in how it does it anyway. Classy ending though, nice touch.</quote>

  <quote>Meh. It's not completely terrible. It throws you a bone once in a while, but it really doesn't do anything special and relies way too heavily on old cliches. I'm aware that the slasher genre is ripe with cliches anyway and it's hard to avoid but you can still be clever. There were no real memorable scenes, which sucks because Myers is such a great villain. The symbolism seemed really tacked on a lot of the time and the ending sucked. But it had a lot of attractive girls. And Weird Al.</quote>

Also, I know they are trying to be quirky but you can't even appreciate the actual mystery of it because they tell you who murdered the girl at the beginning.

Any message of self-confidence (which is iffy because this is a pretty hypocritical movie at times) is lost in that. I laughed once or twice, and Michelle Williams was apparently there and awesome (I didn't even recognize her)… but that's about all the positivity I can muster for this.</quote>

  <quote>As much as I like hearing Kevin Smith talk (the Evening With... dvds are fantastic), I just really wasn't into it. Maybe it's just the fact that while Mewes is funny, too much of him really just starts getting boring. I did laugh a few times, but I can't really recommend this one.</quote>

  <quote>At least M. Night tries. It tries to be an interesting fairy tale and while some of it is wonky, it's really not as offensive as people think. Yes, he kills a critic and yes, he put himself as the character whos writing will inspired the world. But the direction is solid like almost always and the script is pretty bad or at most, mediocre. That's what he does usually. But I liked the beginning part and a few parts. The acting had its ups and downs.</quote>

  <quote>Just kinda boring, and that shouldn't be the case with this premise and the cast involved. I mean, Dafoe, Affleck and Hathaway and there's very little of note in the entire movie? Sure, Hathaway emotes when she has to and it's fine, but it never really hits the notes that it has to. The ending is a little sad, but that's about it. Mostly it's just a hard-to-follow plot that doesn't reveal much of interest when you do figure out what's going on.</quote>

A few gags worked, like with the stereotypical redneck Woody, but the laughs didn't come often. I had to wade through a lot of shit to find any gold nuggets.

A little bit of that is expected in movies but not this much. Also, The Death Cure goes on far too long. It did not earn this runtime.</quote>

  <quote>Awful awful ending, it's so abrupt. They could have put an extra 10 minutes in between the two things that happen, something to make it seem to matter. Besides that, there are a couple good action scenes but nothing amazing. For it not doing anything that well, and for there being so many movies like this, you don't need to see it. It's not shitty enough to run away from it like it's a zombie, but it's also not good enough to recommend.</quote>

  <quote>Clarkson's character annoyed me so much. She's a fine actress but the dialogue that spewed out of her mouth was infuriating, dull and tryhard. The Party might have gotten a little smile or two from me, but it wasn't funny, which would be fine if they were saying anything interesting. A chamber drama needs excellent writing and this lacked it, which is a shame because there's talent here and the actors are doing what they can with it. With that said, the ending was a nice kicker. Not recommended.</quote>

  <quote>This was very by the books, but not a bad movie. It felt like a typical indie dramedy, where a family is fucked up, some 'quirky' things happen (in this case, porn shops and RAGING BONERS), and everyone eventually lets out how they feel at the end. It's depressing that it's so impressively average though, considering C. Hall  is always a pleasure, Silverman is funny, Mara is gorgeous, and Greer has a charm about her. Talent doesn't lead to much here though. Again, not awful, just 'normal.'</quote>

  <quote>I didn't like it. I don't know if it's just the mood I was in when I watched it but I could not get invested in it and didn't find it funny. I think I laughed once, I hardly smiled. The Anderson awkwardness/quirkiness didn't get me this time, which I think is something he risks whenever he makes a movie (at least from what I've seen).</quote>

  <quote>I'm mad at the beginning when the kid is ripped from his bike because it makes no sense once everything is revealed. It's just a trick, not storytelling. Correct me if I'm wrong there. I was into this for the first act while viewing it, it was ominous and interesting, then they killed all suspense with annoying dinks taking over in the second act. The third act is pretty good though, I liked the twist at the very end. Very uneven movie. Not recommending this because again, fuck that beginning.</quote>

  <quote>Theory: The character played by Zayas was taking anger management, it got cancelled because of aliens, and he was angry cuz of it... that's how I explain his needless aggression. Awful character. The rest of the movie was actually decent... the first half an hour/40 mins was good then it got a little wonky. That would have been forgiven if the ending wasn't one of the worst endings ever. You build up to that and you don't give me at least 15 minutes of CGI ass-kicking? You suck.</quote>

  <quote>Unfortunately I just didn't feel a thing while watching this. Ellen Page was good and I've always enjoyed her, but that's about it. I didn't find the movie funny, I didn't find it dramatic, I didn't think the romance was interesting, it wasn't a clever movie. It was just kind of there, kind of blah, so I don't really HATE the movie... just not worth seeing because it's just another film like this in a huge sea of them.</quote>

  <quote>There are things I enjoy, like a few jokes that hit pretty hard, and the chemistry between Hawn and Schumer (being real friends helps). I think without them this is a lot lesser, and I say that as a person who is hit-or-miss on Schumer. But the problem is that we have a comedy and most of it just isn't funny. I'm used to comedies hitting with an audience and not me, but I didn't even hear that many laughs in the theatre this time.</quote>

  <quote>I try to review movies based on whether it accomplishes what it sets out to do or not. That's a pretty decent way of rating things, and this certainly does accomplish what it sets out to do. It's neat for 1971 but now I feel like I'm watching Windows Media Player. I don't recommend it because I didn't like it, though yes, if this is what you want from a film, it will work for you.</quote>

But it's dull, the plot is terribly written, people do stupid things, and it has that Netflix darkness that is just kind of murky. The interactions between Julia and Tau are fairly compelling and emotional, but the movie has to take some dumbass leaps to allow those to happen.</quote>

There could have been some emotional resonance here but the silliness trampled all over it. I dislike the train station scene.</quote>

Big, expressive statements that feel hokey, repetition of key phrases (YOU ARE SO SPECIAL) to the point of exhaustion.

The theme/message of the movie, while not original, is certainly positive and I can't bring myself to hate that aspect, but the movie stumbles.</quote>

If a middle-aged guy swearing and being mean to everyone is funny to you, then seriously, power to ya, but -- at least in this case -- it didn't do it for me.

The music isn't necessarily bad but it's clumsy, coming off as contrived like the rest of it.</quote>

I'm not saying that it wants to do a Tarkovsky movie, but they didn't have the same understanding of grace and beauty that he did. You also see a lot of side-face &quot;emoting&quot; with minimal dialogue most of the time, which isn't thoughtful... it just drags on.</quote>

Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Dark and gritty didn't really work. I appreciate the efforts to make it a bit of a sci-fi horror movie at times, but the cheesy dialogue, sub-par visual effects (in comparison to other movies, still not completely terrible as a whole), and the way they punked Doom in about 20 minutes or so... just a bad time. There were a couple scenes like when Doom first awakens, and when the F4 are first dealing with their problems, but it's too little in a movie that overstays its welcome. Slow and boring.</quote>

  <quote>No chemistry between the two, Johnson doing her best. Still has boring sex scenes, and the build-up never amounts to anything sexy. Despite 3 movies of an unconvincing relationship that doesn't feel like it earns it, the ending montage of their love somehow is relatively affective. With all this said, this is the best of the three; this is the closest I've come to enjoying it. If the ridiculousness of what goes on was more fun this could have been a pretty silly, yet entertaining, trilogy.</quote>

  <quote>I like found footage movies but this is a really poorly done one. Bad acting, a reliance on jump scares that don't work (quit panning the camera back and forth to make us anticipate a scare, you're doing it to death), and off-putting visuals. It has a few good moments and I'm torn on the ending because it's a little too convenient, but it also has the scariest part (outside of the one scene that's in the trailer). Meh.</quote>

  <quote>This was tiring. There were a few good scenes, some of them oddly beautiful and some just straight up creepy/offbeat. But I also can't ignore the fact that it's rather mundane self-reflection and murdering people for 2 and a half hours for the most part. I've never disliked a von Trier flick but this is a first. Dillon was mostly quite good in this but some of the acting was hokey as fuck and I didn't think it was as visually inspired as some of von Trier's other stuff.</quote>

  <quote>Think it relies too much on bringing celebrities in, like just having them there makes everything better. There's a good way to do this and a bad way, this movie is a bad way. I only laughed a few times and they weren't much in the way of laughs, and the emotional stuff was very up and down. At one point I felt for them, then the formulaic ending didn't make me feel like it should. I don't know if that was the scripts fault or the actors, probably the script.</quote>

  <quote>If the movie was like the first half or so, this would be one of the worst movies ever. At about the halfway mark, it becomes tolerable, a little funnier and a little more emotional. Sure, it's a shitty version of the first Mean Girls (which was pretty funny), but at least it redeems itself a little bit. The principal was hilarious though, so it's nice to see that there's at least one awesome character in a crappy movie. Don't bother with this.</quote>

  <quote>If you were to explain some of the things in this movie to someone it would come across as a lot better than it is. The ending was fantastic and so was Pitt, and that's all I can really give it. Maybe a few pretty good scenes scattered throughout. At first seeing Daltons' old movies was endearing, then it got boring. Which is the main problem here: it's tedious. Things introduced lazily and never explored. Snappy dialogue is rare. No reason to care as it aimlessly moves from point to point.</quote>

  <quote>As M_A said, it's not frightening after the first 30 minutes, which is a shame because there is some genuinely creepy imagery on display and it feels like it's building at that point. It only leads into a drama, perhaps horror-tinged but that's only because there are ghosts (ghosts don't automatically mean scary). But even the reflective nature of the drama isn't compelling, and by the time the (spoilers) apocalypse starts it's too late, and then it ends. Cool ending but a slog to get there.</quote>

  <summary>The story of a family struggling to survive in a world terrorized by a deadly, primeval species who have bred for decades in the pitch darkness of a vast underground cave system, hunting only with their acute hearing. As the family seeks refuge in a remote haven where they can wait out the invasion, they start to wonder what kind of world will remain when they're ready to emerge.</summary>
  <quote>I just found it dull, that's my main complaint. I don't know if a world without A Quiet Place would have changed the way I approached it (probably) but there just wasn't anything here outside of a couple sacrifices which had sufficient emotional oomph. Some hokey dialogue/acting, a boringly slow pace, unexplored plot points/character traits, an unsatisfying ending. This isn't a complete disaster, per se, it's just not even decent and definitely not worth watching.</quote>

  <quote>I really wanted to like this, but unfortunately it was a reminder of why I only watch AVGN casually. I don't like his videos where he makes plots and stuff, and when he chains together swear words it isn't funny like something like Trailer Park Boys. His reviews are great and clever, the rest isn't. It was too long and while there were good moments (like the credits and the ending in general), and it was a nice piece of indie film making with a lot of passion and love.

Backed into a corner, the doctor recruits his divorced office manager (Jennifer Aniston) and her kids to perform as his wife and family -- generating a flood of farcical results and unintended consequences.</summary>
  <quote>The two kids and Sandler's cousin are the funny parts. The rest is not funny nor entertaining, and some scenes go on way too long.  Mostly meh, with some really funny parts few and far between.</quote>

  <quote>I have yet to see a mumblecore movie that did it for me. Now, I've only seen two and they've both been Swanberg movies, so I haven't exactly dug deep. Kissing on the Mouth was an almost recommendation, but this just sucked. I don't know what it is, I did not remotely care about these characters, so it kind of fails in what mumblecore is normally known for: character studies.</quote>

  <quote>For any good there is bad. Makes sense that they don't put the camera down because the spirit camera allows them to see what's going on, but what you see isn't great, and the demon doesn't look threatening. The plot wraps up nicely, but it shouldn't have taken this long to do it (money money money). Jump scares with no buildup, it is way too reliant on 3D to the point of obnoxiousness. We'll always have the first PA, at least.</quote>

Complicating matters, Nicloe's wannabe-boyfriend joins the chase in this high-octane comedy from director Andy Tennant.</summary>
  <quote>It felt a lot longer than it was, these two didn't have any chemistry and the script tried too hard. Yet, it's not quite as bad as people seem to be saying and it certainly isn't as bad as my PSI indicated (1? Really?). There are better rom-coms, and some of them are even this year.

  <quote>The main villain was so over the top. His looks also screamed pedo/villain. Anyway, besides that, people just didn't act believable at all, especially the one cop who was so irrational it was pathetic. Even the drama didn't make me feel anything. This should be a crushing tale because the subject matter is, but there was no depth here. No emotion. The script let this one down hard, but the atmosphere was pretty awesome. Snowy Canada is a dark, depressing place. perfect for a movie like this.</quote>

But it's incredibly dull with a script that shits all over the concept of characterization or exploring their themes with any kind of depth. The sex scenes are boring too mostly because for 3/4 of the movie there's nothing around them. Seriously, where's the plot for most of it? Gets better near the end but it's too little too late.

  <quote>Undeniably bad, with very little to praise. I guess you could say that some of the CGI is cool--or at least the designs are kinda neat--but a majority of the time it's pretty bad. Couple that with a terrible script and bad acting and you kinda wonder what they did with the huge budget. I'm not even offended by the whitewashing, but I can see why people would be. I'm more upset that Proyas made such a turd, because I think he's a very underrated director. This movie tries things but fails hard.</quote>

  <summary>&quot;The Masked Saint&quot; is based on a true story about one pastor's mission to help his community by risking his identity and returns to his former life as a wrestler. The triumphant story follows one man's journey and struggle between helping others and the consequences he faces doing this.</summary>
  <quote>Unfortunately it falls victim to the same problems that many faith-based films do; storytelling is secondary to the sermons and lessons, to the point that it's mostly cheesy and stupid, no finesse. And the way pro-wrestling is treated is especially lame. When he says he's been wearing a mask in the ring and people in his church got offended I cringed. Chris solves all problems with kindness so there's no real drama. Can't hate on the message, but an uplifting scene or two can't save this farce.</quote>

  <summary>A moronic gas station attendant is seduced by a woman in a story that runs parallel to the opera &quot;Carmen&quot;.</summary>
  <quote>1: I know what it's like to be used for taco sauce, gas and ding dongs. 2: The bitch had it coming. But besides these two things, what the hell? Maybe I'm being overly sensitive in a comedy, but this just seems mean spirited. He's not a &quot;moron,&quot; he comes across more as having legit mental problems. I chuckled a bit at like, two parts, but the laughter was very mild, and it wasn't at Joey and how HAHA HE'S A MORON he is. This is kind of a shit short.</quote>

After the men are killed in action, the artifact is sent to the commanding officer's widow who is a teacher at a small-town orphanage. The orphans accidentally summon the Krampus and the teacher, and her pupils are forced to battle this ancient evil. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Seems about right to make you wait an hour for Krampus to show up and then have most of his introduction be him standing in a room talking with a terrible voice. Normally I'd skip this kind of shit but I'm cheering for Krampus. It's very low-budget so some things need to be forgiven but you don't need a good budget to make a good script or a movie that is paced well. This is slow, nonsensical, and boring. Krampus has no menace.</quote>

Vinnie Jones co-stars in this gritty actioner as Anton Vargas, a tough-talking former Mafia boss turned inmate who runs the place like a well-oiled machine.</summary>
  <quote>Better than Shawshank. Here's my problem... Rashad Evans is seen throwing punches in this movie but he doesn't throw punches anymore. Zing! But seriously, shit movie. The acting is awful and made even worse by the fact the script is amazingly bad. Nothing really works in this... it definitely isn't a &quot;gritty actioner.&quot; It tries to be but fails. I actually enjoy seeing Kimbo Slice and Vinnie Jones, though.</quote>

It seems like a great idea - until they discover that their most private video is no longer private. (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>Well the ideas behind is are nice. You even think it's neat in the first minute... not 6. It goes into &quot;Shit&quot; territory. Watch it for 30 seconds and then you got the general idea. So points for the ideas expressed, no matter how abstract, and points for it being ballsy.</quote>

  <summary>Special Agent Ross's (Randy Couture) plans to reconcile with his ex-fianc+ª are ruined when she boards a private jet that is targeted by hijackers working for the same crime lord he is chasing. With no time to inform his team, Ross wriggles his way aboard the aircraft and risks it all to save the love of his life. An adrenaline fueled action packed film that puts the fear back in flying! (amazon.com)</summary>
  <quote>I hate to say it because I want him to be successful in movies, but Couture is a problem here. He lacks great acting ability at this point in his career... in a movie like The Expendables he's surrounded by action stars so he's not a &quot;leading man,&quot; plus he needs a competent director to manage him. This movie doesn't have that. There's no tension, bad dialogue, run-of-the-mill plot, a couple wasted cast members like Holt and Vinnie. Terrible all around.</quote>

  <quote>I get it. I don't think it does a particularly great job at doing it, but I know what is going on. I mostly gave it some points because I laughed in the beginning when Mickey was making a motion like he was jerking his little mouse dick. I laughed more when there were two of 'em side by side. I'm simple like that. But then the rest is just Mickey glory shots. Neat choice of music though, Anger is generally fun in that regard.</quote>

  <quote>It actually consistently insults its audience, which is gamers obviously, calling us losers and not understanding how crucial games are to people TODAY (they say Sandler's skills are outdated at one point). Besides that, well, it's part of it... but it's just lazy jokes. Another Sandler joint that fails horribly. The visuals are kinda neat though, and nostalgia is okay if there's something built around it -- which there isn't. But I still like seeing Tetris destroy buildings!</quote>

  <quote>CASH IN! The cinematography has its moments, the script is bad and the actors are about as bad as the script. Where's the interaction or the chemistry? Where's the half intelligent dialogue or plot? The music usage is mixed, so it has its moments as well. Since it's a sequel maybe it should expand on the Donnie Darko universe but it really doesn't. Just a bunch of events (really... remade from DD) loosely linked together, but what's the reasoning behind it? The more I write the more I hate it.</quote>

  <summary>When a missing page from the diary of John Wilkes Booth surfaces, Ben's great-great grandfather is suddenly implicated as a key conspirator in Abraham Lincoln's death. Determined to prove his ancestor's innocence, Ben follows an international chain of clues that takes him on a chase from Paris to London and ultimately back to America. This journey leads Ben and his crew not only to surprising revelations, but also to the trail of the world's most treasured secrets. (Walt Disney Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>While the first was actually pretty good, this fails on multiple levels. The story is poorly conceived and executed. Things just happen a little too conveniantly ruining any suspense/thrills that it could possibly have. Cage is okay, just being Cage. The action sequences are insanely boring and didn't make me fear for their lives at all. But I'm sure there's worse out there so hence the 10.</quote>

By reading a mysterious novel, &quot;The Number 23,&quot; given to him as a birthday gift by his wife, Walter twists his once placid existence into an inferno of psychological torture that could possibly lead him to his death and the deaths of his loved ones. And all because of a number: The Number 23.  (New Line Cinema)</summary>

  <quote>It takes a potentially emotional premise, and shits all over it with a godawful script, shitty editing (the movie jumps around from moment to moment with no cohesion) and mostly bad acting (though I think the problems are more to do with the script... you just can't do justice no matter how good you are). When you're watching how people act in this movie, you're left wondering, 'Did I miss something?&amp;amp;quot; No, you didn't, stop beating yourself up over it.

  <quote>Not so bad it's good because it's pieced together too well; it gets the basics of filmmaking right, meaning there's a cohesiveness here most of the time. It's straight up bad because the dialogue, plot and acting is complete nonsense, with them clearly stating intentions/personality traits, or acting way too (ridiculously) polite. They say they won't do things then do it, they're taking her to a place she was going to go anyway. I laughed. Ending is hilarious, last 30 mins was boring though.</quote>

If he edited it down a little bit this would be so much HACKING better. Terrible acting, scenes don't flow into one another, there's no reason why this is a paranormal political drama thriller, and the HACKING suicides are funny. HACKING. Funny.</quote>

  <quote>So if you're going to have a movie with characters that are basically a vehicle for whatever political beliefs you have, don't you think you should NOT fuck up what those beliefs are? This isn't anarchism. But it cleverly pretends to be, pulling you in with surface statements that actually slaughter the ideology once you see the context and where they go with it. As a MOVIE, it's completely amateur in the worst way possible. Looks like crap, feels like crap. Plot is crap. Characters are crap.</quote>

A successful banker, Johnny, is madly in love with his fiancé, Lisa, and plans to be married next month. His plans take a horrid turn when he finds the truth about Lisa and the people surrounding him. (IMDB)</summary>
  <quote>Oh, hi Criticker. Okay so, this movie is awful but the 1 is misleading. I can't give it a high mark but with that said, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS MOVIE! You are my favourite customer! God this was a funny movie but like one person said, it can be boring at times. Still better than The Anarchist Cookbook.</quote>

  <summary>This is a film taken of the execution of Topsy, an elephant employed to help build Luna Park on Coney Island. She had killed three men, including a drunken spectator who fed her a cigarette. Cyanide-laced carrots fed to her by park officials failed, and the ASPCA forbade a hanging. Thomas Edison, meanwhile, had been publicly killing dogs and cats with AC power to show that his DC power was more effective and less dangerous. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This might be the first 0 I've ever given a movie. People have commented on Edison, so I don't have to, so I'm taking my disgust out on something else: Criticker. Why did you think I'd give this a 19? What the fuck Criticker, I thought we were friends.</quote>
