  <summary>Batman and James Gordon join forces with Gotham's new District Attorney, Harvey Dent, to take on a psychotic bank robber known as The Joker, whilst other forces plot against them, and Joker's crimes grow more and more deadly.</summary>
  <quote>I find it really romantic in a way that this was Ledger's last (full) film. Heath re-defined the villain, certainly in the sense of comic book movies. And Christian Bale is definitely my favorite Batman now, de-throning Val Kilmer. nJoy says Ledger's performance is genius, and while I agree, he's not the only one. I think Eckhart virtually perfected Dent/Two-Face, even though the Two-Face portion of the film was mishandled. Underscored throughout by the notion that even the best of us can fall.</quote>

  <quote>Well then... I guess I've seen 11 perfect movies. There is, literally, no end to the praise I can give this film. It's engaging, it's both reactive and proactive, it's heartbreaking, enthralling, thrilling, intelligent, and wholly and entirely captivating. It's an experience more than a movie. Unlike some others, I think Marion Cotillard deserves a ton of praise for her performance. Leo was flawless, but again, as good as he was, he had a co-star (Gordon-Levitt) that matched him step for step.</quote>

  <quote>Rocky is the fucking man, and I did cry at the end. This was the perfect way to end this 'logue. Obby said something about &quot;the best in the series after what is viewed as the worst in the series&quot;, and I agree with that. Tarver did a great job too portraying a heavyweight even though he's only I believe a middleweight fighter. &quot;Balboa&quot; is as much about Rocky letting go of boxing and the past as it is about Sly letting go of Rocky, and it was absolutely beautiful how he (they) come(s) full circle.</quote>

  <quote>One of the funniest films ever to exist, even 30-plus years later. It's rare when a film can smartly entertain four-plus decades of moviegoers, but Mel Brooks can. I would be willing to call this Jon Candy's signature performance, may he rest in peace; Bill Pullman and Daphne Zuniga are hilarious, and this is the one and only time I am not annoyed by Joan Rivers' voice. Plus, good ol' Dom Deluise, who I could watch make breakfast, provides the voice of Pizza the Hut. Undoubtedly a perfect film.</quote>

  <quote>Shocking, I know, but let me mark out. Mickey Rourke is the fucking man. The fact that he worked so hard to really understand the world of pro wrestling, taking insight from a lot of well-respected men in the industry, is a testament to the industry itself. This flick made me cry, which it probably shouldn't have, but pro wrestling holds such a tender place in my heart, that this flick would have had to work hard to disappoint me. Tomei and ERW were great eye candy, and played compelling roles.</quote>

  <quote>It does the dramedy mix with subtle perfection: the funny parts are funny and the serious parts are serious, neither were half-assed attempts at both, and awareness displayed that they need each other. Drama needs comedy to humanize and lighten its subject matter; comedy needs drama to deftly remind the audience that the subject matter is not meant to be light and fluffy. I loved the performances completely, the so-called &quot;predictability&quot; is debatable at best... it does everything exceptionally.</quote>

  <quote>With a veritable all-star lineup, a beloved soundtrack, innovative cinematography... part of me wants to say this writes the book for war flicks (even though it's much more than &quot;a war flick&quot;), whether it's the definitive one or not has some debate. But what can be said for sure is that this flick is near-perfect, badass in every way, and shows unequivocally that the classics never die, as a 2009 audience would get as much (if not more) appreciation out of it as did the 1979 audience.</quote>

  <quote>I comfortably snuggle Avatar up to District 9 in terms of sci-fi flicks this year. Yes, it'll take shit for costing so much - you can't whitewash $400mil-plus - and yea, the character design looks awkward - hard to avoid when you're going for &quot;humanoid but not human&quot; - but Cameron created a world here that rivals Middle Earth, designed and built life forms that are spiritually gorgeous and simplistic, and made a linear plot totally sparkle. But I'm biased towards sci-fi, so take it how you will.</quote>

  <quote>In my Fellowship-like journey of ranking Infinity War, I had to come to a decision: is this movie one of my favorite movies of all-time? As in, is it worth a rating of 100? Ultimately, it isn't a 100 - but it's closer to a 100 than my 85 PSI. Put aside the &quot;culmination of the last ten years&quot; argument (even though it's a good one) - Thanos is every bit the badass that I needed him to be. The best villain in MCU history leads to its best ending in history. Rich, vibrant storytelling. A must-watch.</quote>

I think it was a real punch in the face for our society and how we handle things that we don't fully understand. Copley plays a flawed but enamoring character. Excellent viral marketing.

  <quote>Goddamn. What a flick. I honestly don't know what else you can ask for in this kind of movie. You start with a really good script that, coupled with a great director that pours himself into every detail, attracts top talent to play your roles perfectly. You continue to display the near-flawless execution you've become famous for. You supplement that execution with lovely toppings (like the phenomenal soundtrack). I'll knock it down slightly for a weak female lead. Other than that, this is elite.</quote>

  <quote>I can imagine that one of the biggest challenges that could ever face an actor would be to attempt to objectively portray one of History's most hated men, who was at the same time a brilliant tactician, military mind, and politician.

Equally impressive to the performance of Ganz as Hitler were those of the Goebbels family; as he is still an under-examined figure.</quote>

  <quote>Fuckin' 80's style. Though the characters are very different, &quot;Driver&quot; has the appeal of Rocky Balboa; that guy that's great at one thing, uses that to get by, and has this overwhelming appeal. You can't hate &quot;Driver&quot;. Gosling carries the film on his back despite relatively little dialogue; 15 minutes into the film, he's said barely two words, yet you're compelled by him. And the whole ambiance, every conceivable aspect of it, the sound, the visuals... pitch-perfect. This is artistic brilliance.</quote>

  <quote>I would argue that this is the most relevant film, from a sociological standpoint, that Kubrick has made. It very effectively showed the mental effects of war on soldiers in such a way that puts it on-par with (or above) movies like 'Platoon'. 'Jacket' is endlessly quotable, topped with classic Kubrick icing. Whether through an academic or purely-pleasurable lens, 'Jacket' delivers a unique, moving viewing experience. It is nothing short of required viewing for any movie fan.</quote>

He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel's superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing -- the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.  A small village is about to get some big city justice.  (Rogue Pictures)</summary>

Balls-to-the-wall performance from the entire main cast, and the flick also says a lot about how the spheres of news and entertainment are essentially one in the same.

The plot is really simple, and if you've seen the trailer you know it. You have your hero, you have seven bosses, and you have the princess trapped by the final boss. You probably die on him the first time, until you fight around and get strong enough to beat him. Classic RPG dynamics. I also absolutely LOVE Mary Elizabeth Winstead. God. So hot.</quote>

Scorsese squeezes the most out of a somewhat formulaic story (maybe, I feel weird even calling it formulaic), to the point that the twist really caught me by surprise, knocked me off guard, and I actually found myself to be *mesmerized* and completely engrossed by the story.

  <summary>Two petty felons have a documentary made about their life in a trailer park. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The original flick that I had the pleasure of seeing at the Atlantic Film Festival, fell in love with it, and hoped against hope to see more of it. Seven seasons and two movies later, the story has ended but the memories remain. Absolutely enthralling work from an extremely underrated director.</quote>

  <quote>Considering a nomination for Hailee Steinfeld for Breakout Actress, and while the book's been written on Mr. Bridges, his praises cannot be sung highly enough. Incredibly breathtaking, this whole film, for obvious reasons (the way it was shot, the performances, time period, etc.) and for less-obvious reasons - one scene in particular, where Damon rips Steinfeld off her horse and spanks her, had the audience just *quiet*, and there was tension, nobody really knew how to react. One of 2010's best.</quote>

  <quote>The Zodiac case is one of the most intriguing psychological cases in U.S. criminological history. The complex intricacies which the killer breaks down into such simple actions are truly fantastic. Robert Graysmith's life is both built up and destroyed by the man who seems to be able to control his mind and moods at will. Superbly acted all around (especially Gyllenhaal &amp;amp; Downey, Jr.), perfectly cast, excellently shot, with writing that was gripping and exciting. Zodiac is nearly a perfect film.</quote>

  <quote>I know the visuals are the first thing most reviews clamour over, and with good cause. There are also certainly things to explore (too many for a mini-review), but to touch on one: drawing a dichotomy between two recent flicks, I preferred the way 9 dealt with &quot;the technology question&quot; over Surrogates; here it was more a case of technology acting on its own, rather than humans, which I dug. And I applaud this flick for being able to make an emotional connection with the audience. Oscar sleeper.</quote>

What &quot;Argo&quot; does phenomenally well aside from performances, is build tension and suspense, and above all, believability. It's human, it's unpretentious... it's great.</quote>

It's action-packed and bleak but maintains its humor, and the execution does the mad hype justice, which was a tall order. 3D was worth it, too.</quote>

Cage is perfectly cast, his chemistry with Kilmer, albeit brief, is pinpoint accurate and believable. Half the fun of this movie I think is debating to yourself, as an audience member, which scenes are actually happening, and which scenes are hallucinations. Some are obvious, others left quite ambiguous. The random sex scene with the young chick while the boyfriend watches, for instance. Remarkable flick.</quote>

This sets a tone, it intertwines a variety of divergent stories and does so seamlessly, and successfully makes the hotel itself its own character, shrouded in the unsolved mystery of its ownership. This drips with style with the meat on the bones to back it up, and in a crowd of strong performances, Chris Hemsworth's California cult leader stands out. I am very on board for everything Drew Goddard does from here on out. Home run.</quote>

  <summary>Barney (Sylvester Stallone) leads a ragtag band of hired guns charged with overthrowing a South American despot, a job no official military unit is willing to touch. But once on the ground, the team learns there's more to the mission than they were told. Their next move determines whether they survive -- or are, indeed, expendable.</summary>
  <quote>It's really, just, amazing. A straight action flick with Sly's trademark genuine and honest wit and humor, and yes, it looks like a novelty because it's full of all these huge names, but it's not intended to be. To the people who say the movie sucks, or it was a bad attempt at a parody (which is dumb, they were going for cheesy action flick), I really don't know what to tell you. If you can't shut off your brain and enjoy, I feel sorry for you. It was, honestly, pure badass, drizzled in awesome.</quote>

  <quote>The only major improvement that I could have suggested, was trying to find somebody who really knows how to choreograph boxing. Some of the in-ring scenes felt hollow, like there was no real story to them; boxing, like pro wrestling (but in a different context) is all about going in the ring and telling a story. The performances were, of course, award-winning and deservedly so, great atmosphere, and one thing I really noticed but not many others here are mentioning - what a bomb soundtrack!</quote>

  <quote>I can't really be compelled to give this any better or any worse rating than the original, but in a roundabout way, that's issuing a lot of praise: how many times have we seen American remakes of European movies fall flat on their face and just embarrass themselves? This one definitely does not! David Fincher's adaptation is phenomenal, and story-wise, I find it to be at least parallel (if not slightly better) than 2009's version. Though it removed some things that were probably better left in.</quote>

  <quote>Gritty, uncompromising vision of masochistic compulsion wrapped in an equally-compelling murder-mystery. Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace deserve every ounce of credit that comes to them; Nyqvist is one of Sweden's finest actors and now a wider audience can appreciate why. Complaints about the movie's supposedly &quot;slow&quot; pacing can mostly be ignored, as the pacing is a perfect companion to its dark, but powerfully-moving, theme. Maybe the ending spills too many beans, but that's a minor gripe.</quote>

I won't give it 100 - although, to be truthful, the series deserves it, and this is coming from a LotR fanboy - but it stands of course as the pinnacle of the series, in story and in quality. The emotional spots all worked, learning more about the Snape backstory was thoroughly engrossing to me, and the only thing that tarnished the experience was the epilogue. It's not like it was BAD or anything, but... it made people laugh, seeing the characters &quot;aged&quot;.</quote>

  <quote>Given my rating system I struggled with whether this was a high 85 or a low 90, and that takes into account that the first half-hour of the movie I really wasn't feeling.

There were certainly hammy moments (the dwarven fight scene with the barrels was almost cringe-worthy it was so hammy). The reveal of Sauron was badass, Smaug's design is great, and the sequel definitely surpasses the first.</quote>

Absolutely LOVED the Quentin-Aldo tangent with the &quot;masterpieces&quot;. The film's opening is worth the ticket price without doubt; Waltz, meet my good friend Oscar.</quote>

  <summary>A bullied young boy befriends a young female vampire who lives in secrecy with her guardian.</summary>
  <quote>Essentially the same movie, but in the best ways possible. It's an American re-make of a foreign movie, that DOESN'T screw the pooch, that maintains much of the grittiness and atmosphere of the original. Chloe Grace-Moretz is carving out a nice little niche for herself in somewhat off-beat, edgy roles which belie her young age. If you've been fortunate enough to see the original, there might be little reason to see this (other than Grace-Moretz's performance), but if not, it's a definite view.</quote>

  <summary>Oskar, a bullied 12-year old, dreams of revenge. He falls in love with Eli, a peculiar girl. She can't stand the sun or food and to come into a room she needs to be invited. Eli gives Oskar the strength to hit back but when he realizes that Eli needs to drink other peoples blood to live he's faced with a choice. How much can love forgive? Let The Right One In is a story both violent and highly romantic, set in the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg in 1982. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU, for FINALLY putting a fucking semi-realistic vampire in a movie, as Eli's character definitely punches Edward Cullen in the balls. At times, I legitimately forgot I was watching a movie, which is something I'm usually always quite aware of. A hauntingly beautiful love story, and something of a contentious one, as many may not understand how Oskar could honestly look past the fact that, hey, his &quot;girlfriend&quot; is a vampire. I hope Stephanie Meyer was taking notes.</quote>

  <quote>I liked it... loved it... REALLY loved it. The whole movie is so aesthetically gorgeous. It's definitely a Woody Allen, that much is assured inside the first five minutes; it has this great 70's feel to it. Aside from a slightly-obnoxiously-long intro scene of Parisian stock footage, the whole thing just flowed so beautifully. I hope you can look past Owen Wilson's fucked-up nose and see his excellent performance as Woody's doppelganger; the leader in this merry band of outstanding performances.</quote>

  <quote>All obvious comparisons to TBWP aside, this was just a genuinely creepy film. I will warn you, most of this flick is atmosphere, which apparently turns people off. I absolutely loved the whole ambiance of the night scenes, then also the daytime scenes once that security blanket gets taken away. Some may consider it &quot;too slow&quot;, I think that's bullshit, the pacing is perfectly methodical; it mirrors the methods of the demon. Micah is a very self-indulgent character, but that is a minor gripe.</quote>

The ruler of Wu, Sun Quan, calls on the rival warlord Liu Bei for help, but their two armies are still badly outnumbered. However, the Wu strategist Zhou Yu sees that Cao Cao's army is unused to battling on the sea, which may just give them a chance if they can exploit this weakness properly. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Big surprise, the guy who's a sucker for the old Asian &quot;dynastic&quot; aesthetic loved a movie about an epic Chinese battle.

I'm really hyped to see the full four-hour version, but at the same time, I'm so glad they cut it down for the North American audience; I'd agree with the notion that this audience wouldn't be able to handle the full thing. Battle choreography was just unreal. But, as Obby noted - a serious lack of Lu Bu.</quote>

  <quote>MAJOR points for the most random Jeff Jarrett appearance ever. That's J-E-double-F, J-A-double-R-E-double-T. I love the juxtaposition of Catholicism against drug use, and the unadulterated passion of the &quot;stereotypical&quot; party. I love how this movie looks and feels. It's beautifully shot and arranged. James Franco OWNS this movie. I can see why people could find some dialogue or segments annoying or weird, or dare I say, &quot;bad&quot;. But to me, it's deliciously over-the-top and just plain amazing.</quote>

  <quote>Unafraid to admit that J.J. has made me a Trekkie again. Marked out for this big time; any imperfections were glossed over at the prospect of seeing a fresh take on the material &amp;amp; the rejuvenation of a series which has meant a lot to television and, to a lesser extent, film. The appearance of Nimoy, while seen as some I'm sure as a cheap pop to appease hardcore Trek fans, really worked for me. The film employs a strong mix of established stars and young talent. Very complete film; Abrams' best.</quote>

[RELEASED IN 2005]</summary>
  <quote>I don't think I'd call Evey mild-mannered. BUT. People came into this movie I think expecting an action film. Boy, don't you feel dumb? Not a lot of people seem to like the contemporization of the graphic novel, but you need to do that sometimes irregardless of the popularity of that decision.  No, it's not the same as the graphic novel.  It doesn't have to be.  The film has a great message -- &quot;People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people.&quot;</quote>

  <quote>NICK-FUCKING-FROST, MOTHER FUCKERS! This is seriously what British movie-making is supposed to be. It's not the over-polished monster movie that you'd get in Hollywood. This would have starred Wahlberg or something if it would have been made States-side. It's funny and raw at the same time, it just elicits that emotional response that only British cinema can pull off. And with kids no less. The atmosphere was perfect, it was shot perfectly, had an excellent ending sequence... A-1 all around.</quote>

I was a little tentative going in, I have to admit, because the more of the trailer(s) that I saw, the more I worried that the movie was going to go &quot;too cornball&quot;, if you get me.

But not only is AoU fun and fulfilling action-wise, the emotional depth steps it up a notch. This leaves us in a great place going forward.</quote>

Adele Exarchopoulos commands her role. Beautifully crafted and human (in both comfortable and uncomfortable ways), with nearly perfect dialogue, I feel the movie easily survives its runtime and over-the-top sex scenes, though it can be criticized for both. The &quot;male gaze&quot; argument is B.S. if you pay attention. Treat yourself.</quote>

  <quote>The ONLY thing that holds this back is that Cap is... kinda boring. It has nothing to do with how Evans is playing him, it's the character itself. Despite that, this movie is TONS of fun. I skipped the 3D this time; heard it wasn't great. The Winter Soldier is a great character and Sebastian Stan is perfect in that role. ScarJo continues to add depth &amp;amp; substance to Black Widow. Though I'm critical of Cap, his relationship with Winter Soldier reeled me in big-time. Among my favorite MCU films.</quote>

Omalu's emotional quest puts him at dangerous odds with one of the most powerful institutions in the world. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This is somewhat emotionally-manipulative for me, which is not so much a criticism as it is an admission. It just leads to a better score than it probably should have. I thought Will was tremendous. Brilliant. I thought his supporting cast was fine, and the production values were solid, with a very blue-collar feel. What I could have done without was the sub-story of Omalu's &quot;romance&quot;. Give it time or don't give it time, but don't half-ass it. It felt half-assed. Everything else is really great!</quote>

Meanwhile, Cal's adolescent son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), has formed an unquenchable crush on his 17-year-old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) -- but is she more interested in Robbie's recently unwed father?</summary>
  <quote>I think some people are confusing the way this movie shifts back and forth in story and mood for having a lack of focus. Rather, I feel the movie has strong focus in multiple places. So happy to see Steve Carell play this kind of character; and at this point, he can do very little wrong. Toss on Julianne Moore (who is fucking gorgeous and still so underrated), Emma Stone (also fucking gorgeous and underrated), Gosling, Bacon, Tomei, and a new-but-beautiful face (Analeigh Tipton).

  <quote>An impressive ensemble headlined (but not defined) by Adrien Brody.

This tests us as an audience and is not meant to &quot;entertain&quot;. It's over the top in a lot of ways, but it uses that hyperbole quite effectively as a means of getting across that the educational and societal systems we depend on are fucked, by forcing people who care not to care anymore.</quote>

  <quote>The back-and-forth between Orser and Winstead is just money. Riley Stearns' love letter to Kubrick (right down to the climactic scene in the bathroom) goes in a couple of different, weird directions, but not in a chaotic way; it's very measured and precise. I'm afraid I have very little else to say about this; it's almost embarrassingly-perfect, and I feel the payoff is very worth it. It doesn't strike me as one of those films I'll want to watch over and over, but you should definitely see this.</quote>

  <summary>Ferris Bueller. Larger than life. Blessed with a magical sense of serendipity. He's a model for all those who take themselves too seriously. A guy who knows the value of a day off. Ferris Bueller's Day Off chronicles the events in the day of a rather magical young man, Ferris (Broderick). One spring day, toward the end of his senior year, Ferris gives into an overwhelming urge to cut school and head for downtown Chicago with his girl (Sara) and his best friend (Ruck) (Paramount)</summary>

  <quote>This gets the friendly bounce into this territory in albeit-brief retrospect, perhaps because I'm not comparing it directly to movies Ritchie made twenty years ago. For me this is a little higher than Man From U.N.C.L.E. Ritchie's bread-and-butter for me has always been his casting and the performances he evokes, and that's no different here as across the board, the ensemble (and individuals) all shine. The finished product paid off on the excellent trailer; seems to seldom happen these days!</quote>

At times. Does the movie tease you with only brief visions of monster mayhem? Yup. Are some aspects just big and stupid? Sure. Does any of that REALLY matter? Nope.

  <quote>The 3D is as ineffective as ever (paying for 3D is a waste of money until it shows some consistency), and the villain is rather forgettable, BUT, it's EXTREMELY entertaining. Good story that contributes well enough to the overall MCU. Very likable characters. Baller-ass soundtrack, and a surprisingly-solid mix of action, drama and comedy (succeeding in not allowing the often-great comedic moments to cut the balls off of sentimental moments). The MCU continues to deliver in a big way. Loved it!</quote>

  <quote>How this tremendously-worthy sequel compares to the first: there's more comedy that's slightly less effective per-capita (I feel Vol. 1 was funnier, though some of that may be the novelty of &quot;the first time&quot;); there's more emotional content that hits harder and sticks with you more strongly than that in the first; and while the first is likely a better movie from an entertainment standpoint, I feel that &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is arguably more complete; among the most well-rounded and best overall MCU films.</quote>

Pretty strong recommend, just doesn't possess that &quot;IT&quot; factor to put it on the top-tier of comedies for me. Thusfar, best comedy of 2009.</quote>

  <quote>I'm finding myself becoming a fan, giving the movies more of a chance than before. Enjoyed the flick. Sadly, Dumbledore's death was all fizzle. I didn't get hit with any emotional response, and found myself paying more attention to the overly-glorified scene of him falling than to the context of his actual death. Also, there was more &quot;romantic&quot;, read: pseudo-sexual, content than I expected to see, which at times, sadly again, detracted from the flick. But I'm sure it was the best of the series.</quote>

  <summary>Clint Eastwood directs this supernatural thriller about three very different people and their responses to death, including a hesitant American psychic named George (Matt Damon) who may be able to help the others find answers and peace.

  <quote>Eastwood explores many themes here, many complex relationships, and traverses them so superbly and with such poise; he may very well be the best director in Hollywood today. I also loved how he shows his own conflict; I don't think he's a personal believer in the so-called &quot;hereafter&quot;, or those that claim to be able to communicate with those that have passed (I think that's fairly obvious), but as a device, BAM, there's someone who CAN. A director that pushes himself. What more can you ask for?</quote>

  <quote>I only feel comfortable ranking this film as on-par with what I consider to be the worst of the three LotR movies (Two Towers). But that's still high praise. The film is full of investment-worthy characters old and new, beautiful environments (a credit to the cinematography), and lined by a more whimsical &amp;amp; youthful tone (even though at times the film is very dark). I'm not a big fan of the use of supplemental Tolkien material just for the sake of another trilogy. But this movie was excellent.</quote>

  <quote>I gotta rank it higher than Hangover II for sure, and it stands as my best mainstream comedy of the year thusfar (into July). Honestly, everyone shines. Bateman is awesome, Sudeikis is awesome, Day might be the flick's MVP which is saying a lot. Always gotta love Kevin Spacey in basically anything, and y'know, this is possibly the first thing post-F.R.I.E.N.D.S that I've been able to tolerate Aniston in. The Spacey-Farrell incident is worth the price of admission. And the movie's ending is EPIC!</quote>

  <quote>I can't speak to the degree in which the movie does or does not follow the books, having not read them. What I can speak to is the significant step forward in quality that &quot;Catching Fire&quot; takes over the first film. This flick is shot much more competently, acted superbly, and on a personal level, satisfies that grittiness and harshness that I saw the potential for in the first. It's more emotional, more dystopian, and just MORE. It leaves you on a solid cliffhanger and leaves you wanting more.</quote>

  <quote>Very funny, well put-together, poignant and organic story about an unconventional (extended) family whose lives get turned upside-down by circumstance and choices. Sounds like your average dramedy but TKAAR is anything but. Excellent performances by the main trio underscore a frustratingly-complicated chain of events leading to the climactic finale. This is what dramedy should be, without question. Ruffalo especially plays an immensely-relatable and investment-worthy character. Love this movie!</quote>

  <quote>I'm surprised that this is classified as a kids movie.  There are a lot of sexual undertones (and overtones) in this film that, if parents had the wits to see them, would probably prevent a lot of kids from seeing it.  But kids should see it, it's a great flick.  This is David Bowie at his most potent.</quote>

  <quote>This was one of the most well-put-together horror flicks of recent memory for me. It has a great premise and the execution to match. The scares were very real, the slow-built tension was just palpable in a way that only great horror flicks can deliver. I wasn't a fan of the ending at first; when it first happened, I was underwhelmed to the point that I was afraid it had ruined the movie. Very scary, very raw and realistic, doesn't rely too too heavily on jump-scares... just a superb horror.</quote>

  <quote>As cliched as it is, eeeeeverything is awesooooome in this movie! I'm very impressed not only with the quality of the animation (how did this not take at least a decade to make?), but with the quality of the story. I love when kids movies add adult subtext to their story; commentaries on Capitalism and freedom, some pretty high-level stuff coming from a nostalgia-driven kids movie. But that's the beauty -- Lego Movie is about so much more than just nostalgia. This is expert animated filmmaking.</quote>

  <quote>While typically I would say that it's hard to justify an award nod to an actor who was only in about half of his movie, I can't deny the things that Dev Patel made me feel in this. For this to be Garth Davis' debut feature film, I believe, marks the outset of what will likely be a pretty brilliant career. It has its flaws, its holes, its moments of crossing the melodramatic line. But what it does do very well is interconnects what are basically two movies in one, to an emotion-driven crescendo.</quote>

Excellent performances from the lead quartet, enhanced by the best Chris Cooper I've seen in years and the always-phenomenal Chalamet.

  <quote>Looper wastes no time getting right to the premise, and when you have a movie like this one that deals with things like time travel and mutations and whatnot, it's good to do that sometimes. It absolutely helps that JGL is phenomenal, just, in general. The whole damn cast here is just excellent and it's got a story that's interesting and keeps a nice pace. It's not too fast but it doesn't crawl either, and there's plenty of emotional &amp;amp; dramatic content for a Sci-Fi flick which was nice. See it!</quote>

  <quote>Getting a lot of unfair flack from critics, by a long shot. There's quite an abundance of Hathaway booby, much more than I'd expected. I also get such a kick out of Josh Gad so that got the movie over a lot. It's a little cliched but honestly, anybody that could have &quot;called&quot; the twist involving Hathaway's character is out of their mind, but while it came out of nowhere it also wasn't &quot;thrown in&quot;, like it was something that was easily acceptable. Very well executed flick, one of the year's best.</quote>

Vincent D'Onofrio is simply awesome. And Chris Pratt remains underrated even now, stealing nearly every scene he's in. If you dig Westerns and great performances, #Mag7 is for you!</quote>

The scene with Megan's life story especially highlights some dark shit that some teenagers do face. It's more than a cautionary tale, it's a disturbing triumph.</quote>

  <summary>A story centered on two vampires who have been in love for centuries. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Twilight crowds from 2008 would be well-served to move on to this. I apologize for evoking Twilight in a review of a movie this good. Pairing Swinton with Hiddleston is a home-run, and the rest of this cast (John Hurt as Christopher Marlowe, Jeffrey Wright, Mia Wasikowska) are spectacular. A little up its own &quot;science-is-awesome, humans-are-idiots, Detroit-will-rise-again, conspiracy-theories-are-right&quot; ass, but it totally works. For a movie where not a lot really happens, this was remarkable.</quote>

But it's a goddamn monster movie, roll with it! The design and execution of the fight scenes is chaotic, but very fun. Middle-of-the-road characters and story, don't care, Kaijus and Jaegers.</quote>

Through circumstances beyond their control, Tyler, a small time outlaw on the run, becomes Zak's unlikely coach and ally.</summary>
  <quote>Such a pleasant surprise. This offers a pretty darn intoxicating combination of entertainment, warmth and poignancy, and attracted a tremendous cast. Bruce Dern and Dakota Johnson are especially good, and Zack Gottsagen's is a performance I can't say enough about. Ditto with fantastic work from Shia LaBeouf. There's a convenience in the storytelling which actually mirrors Zak's perspective (ie. &quot;We should get a plane&quot; to cross a river), intentionally or not. At times, uproariously funny. A gem!</quote>

She steps on an exposed nail while in labour, and doesn't crack. Emily Blunt is a superhero, and this is one great damn movie. Krasinski nailed it.</quote>

But he's forced to return to old habits when a shadowy assassin puts a target on his back and goes after the woman (Mary-Louise Parker) he loves. Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich co-star as former members of Moses's team who reluctantly reassemble to save his life.</summary>
  <quote>Very comical, indulgent fun. And for those that think there's &quot;too much talent for the movie&quot;, well, again, that's the indulgence factor coming into play. That makes it awesome! Frank Moses is a role that I believe is more suited to Brucey at this stage in his career, as opposed to, say, the role he played in &quot;Surrogates&quot;. Morgan Freeman's character was probably the one I enjoyed the most, but the entire ensemble was just fantastic. I really like Mary-Louise Parker; she's extremely underrated.</quote>

  <quote>It's hard to film something serious with apes and not have it come off silly and laughable. Rupert Wyatt does so brilliantly. I was worried as the movie drew to an end. It was heading towards a place that really would have been a travesty, and would not have done justice to the movie's execution. Thankfully it snatches itself off that cliff with the scenes embedded in the credits. Well-pitched performances (love Franco but MVP of the movie clearly goes to Lithgow), pacing was excellent.

  <quote>To claim that THIS MOVIE &quot;brilliantly defines the decade&quot;, as has been claimed multiple times, is quite pompous, but you can never deny the juggernaut status that Facebook has achieved. Sorkin tells a story, rather than sticking to immutable fact, which is probably better (the factual story is interesting, it's just better in overblown narrative form), but the real brilliance behind this flick is the soundtrack. Beautiful promotion and in-film execution. Great casting and performances as well.</quote>

While doing exactly what the MCU does best and exactly what a Spider-Man movie should do, Homecoming has some noteworthy accomplishments. It better grounds the MCU with its hero, also giving us an instance of tension and stakes (more MCU films fail at this than succeed). Holland, Keaton, Tomei and RDJ are excellent. They also didn't waste our time with yet another retelling of the origin. Breaks little new ground, but contributes nonetheless.</quote>

  <quote>I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did for a movie that I took as seriously as I did! It was an interesting blend of comedy and Sci-Fi action-adventure. The new take on the material is still fresh and still holds together surprisingly well. But while it has a much better antagonist this time around, I don't feel that this episode quite matched up to the first. Maybe it harkened back to &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; a little too much. Maybe it was too much fan service altogether. But I'm a fan so it works!</quote>

  <quote>I think maybe, just maybe... I just like Star Wars. And maybe, just maybe... that's okay. I read the criticisms. I hear you, or I at least try to hear you. And there are some criticisms that I can even get on board with. This isn't the best movie of this trilogy, franchise, genre, year, or all-time, and I'd never argue that it is. And maybe I can't articulate as well as usual WHY these movies didn't fail me like they've apparently &quot;failed&quot; many in this fanbase. Maybe... I just like Star Wars.</quote>

  <quote>Full disclosure: I wanted this to go in a direction that it didn't really go narrative-wise, and it's a movie that, in some ways, feels more &quot;same-y&quot; than TFA ever did to me. But my second viewing absolutely helped, and I can't recommend that strongly enough. It does a bunch of fun, cool stuff. There are only really a few sparce parts to the movie that take me out of things, and I overblew my distaste for other things. Take it as it is, not as how you wished it was, and it's a pretty good movie.</quote>

  <quote>It's stylish and at times abstract, and tries to say much more with atmosphere and tone than with words. I like the India character a lot, I like the three-plus-person world that most of the movie portrays, it's a very slow build which I think is done quite well. Intense sexual tension is built throughout, with borderline-spectacular direction, symbolism and artistic vision. Some could write it off as pretentious or predictable; I consider it a valentine to art lovers. Enjoy it; I know I did!</quote>

  <quote>I put it below Cloverfield by an inch or so but the two films are very comparable in my level of enjoyment. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was! The group of kids were awesome, every single one of them. I do agree that the ending was a little rushed, and fell together way too easily, but the ending certainly wasn't bad enough to torpedo the whole flick. Rather, it was convention done very well, and that's enough for me. Elle was fantastic. Very heartfelt monster dramedy. New genre? Haha.</quote>

Your expectations are clearly fucked up. &quot;Ted&quot; is a very funny modern fairy tale whose comedy succeeds in carrying the 100-plus-minute run-time with relative ease; it didn't feel too long or too short. It's always great to see Mila. Comedies that try to add weighty emotional content often fall on their faces. Ted pulls it off. Cudos, Seth!</quote>

Initially, the pacing of the movie troubled me -- Hawking's diagnosis occurs at around the half-hour mark of the two-hour movie -- but it was quickly evident WHY it's that way. It's a difficult proposition to present Hawking not only respectfully, but accurately. The Hawkings' daily lives become unpleasant, and difficult to watch. I like difficulty in movies like this -- relationships, ideas, and events. This was great.</quote>

You're also seeing the winds of change in the MCU starting to flare up, even in small ways. I'm concerned that we're running out of time to properly build to Infinity War. But this was great.</quote>

  <quote>This is strongly in the conversation of the best films I've seen all year to this point (mid-April). Jessica Chastain is utterly dominant in almost every second of screen time, and she is matched shot for shot by Daniel Bruhl who puts in what I would argue to be the performance of his career. This is an intense and vibrant film, and brutal when necessary. It perhaps beats an old drum in its narrative but when the drum itself is timeless, you can't ever hear it too often.

  <quote>This hits me as one of those high-level efforts from Disney, on the level of a Big Hero 6, and I would put it up against the best that the Disney-Pixar combination has to offer as well. This movie is ridiculously well-rounded; it's a great &quot;family night at the movies&quot; flick, it's a great date night flick, it's a great solo viewing. It's just plain great. I love the dynamics of the city, and both the subtle and overt allegories to racism and segregation. Deceptively smart. Do yourself the favour.</quote>

  <quote>There is so much technical and creative brilliance found here. The film makes great use of juxtaposition in a number of places (screaming and crying over top of biblical preaching, for instance), and it is filmed in a subtle, nigh-perfect way. Others have mentioned it, but the shots of Ejiofor hanging from the tree on his toes waiting to be released are seriously intense. I don't find myself as overwhelmed with love for this movie as others seem to be, but I recognize its brilliance nonetheless.</quote>

  <quote>I respect this movie a lot, not only for how it was made (I always enjoy watching the various camera gimmicks and tricks used to create the single-shot illusion), but also because of what it represents: something of a love letter to the stories of Sam Mendes' grandfather. Chapman and MacKay are both good while neither steps into being spectacular, and while this certainly would have landed on my Best of 2019 list had I seen it in time, it's a solid kickoff to 2020.

  <quote>Felt very similar to Safe House for some reason. Aside from Denzel being in both, don't ask me why. That being said, this came off to me a good deal better than Safe House did. This flick was thoroughly entertaining popcorn fare that wasn't trying to be anything more than it was -- a crime-based action-comedy with grit and quick wit at the same time, tons of chemistry between the leads, and an intriguing (and at the same time, familiar) story. It came highly recommended and it didn't disappoint.</quote>

But sometimes it's kind of cool for movies to do that; we know where we're going, why waste time? When Channing Tatum said &quot;You want me to beat your dick off?&quot;, I almost died. There are really great moments and lines, and a splattering of sentimentality too. The movie delivers on what it promises on the surface, and that's about all it needs to do.

  <quote>The serious Kubrickian, &quot;2001&quot; vibes had me hooked from the opening frames. You need the perfect performer to pull off such heavy exposition, especially given that most of it is internal dialogue. Pitt, luckily, was that performer, with two other tremendous talents to play off of in Sutherland and Jones. Spectacular direction, even though the ending feels a little rushed, and there are certain Sci-Fi clichÃ©s that maybe could have been left to the side. Plus, rabid space monkeys. There's that.</quote>

  <quote>Quite enjoyable! I know I've seen Robert Zemeckis films before (most recently Flight, which I didn't like nearly as much as this), but a tip of the cap for his direction is in order. The atmosphere is on-point. By now, anyone who has read a review of a Marion Cotillard movie from me knows that I really love her, and she dazzles once again. I guess my one main criticism here is that the ending lends itself to the frustration of middle-ground in terms of the movie's main question: was she a spy?</quote>

  <quote>This is performance pornography. Is there a single name actor in this flick that doesn't nail their role?

The dialogue is quick-witted, and the whole feel of the movie is entertaining and light, given that we're talking about ABSCAM and some pretty serious subject matter. It skews a little over-the-top and cartoony at times, but I get the feeling that was an intentional stylistic choice. See it!</quote>

Stifler saves the day with his intro (and virtually every scene he's in). And Eugene Levy controls every scene he's in both comedically and sentimentally. The movie definitely gets funnier as it goes along, and there's some stuff in there that's pretty emotional too - it has the same kinda of-age connection that Clerks II had with me. Excellent.</quote>

  <quote>Marvel did a good job insulating this movie with a solid cast. Stoll is probably the least-believable MCU villain but for Ant-Man, it works, and the supporting cast (Mackie, Cannavale, Pena) compliments the star power of Rudd &amp;amp; Douglas. This entertains! I like that they made a point of addressing the &quot;why not just call the Avengers?&quot; question, and I feel that the creators wanted to make it a point to have Ant-Man stand on his/its own as a character/movie. This can contribute strongly to the MCU.</quote>

  <summary>Batman must battle Two-Face and The Riddler with help of an amourous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin</summary>
  <quote>Campy, off-the-wall, and I didn't really like the way TLJ portrayed Two-Face.  But still, it's a Batman movie and thus is worth the watch.  Val Kilmer is an amazing Batman, really took the more human side of Bruce Wayne and enhanced that, to the point where Bruce was as important as Batman.  Not a fan of Chris O'Donnell.</quote>

  <quote>Had some very lovely images, but this is one of those flicks that will be rather contentious just because of the subject matter. I'd like to see Michelle Rodriguez play a different character every once in awhile. She's pretty dialed in to the squinch-faced quasi-badass Latina, which gets boring. I was all over the sometimes-seamless transition between dramatized depiction and legit footage of the riots. Things could have been better, some of the dialogue was wonky while some was brilliant.</quote>

  <quote>We've long been convinced of Steve Carell's authenticity and mastery of his chosen art form, but that fact is renewed and strengthened here. One can be forgiven if the ultimate message of the film gets lost, as it could be any number of things, both positive and negative. The bouncing narrative style is very much noticeable, and again, forgivable if it leans on you, but the movie operates much like the mind in that frustrating sense; rarely do memories work in sequence. A trying, but nice touch.</quote>

  <quote>Linklater's strength is his dialogue and his utterly beautiful characters. Practical and rational on the surface, yet at their cores I think these people are truly sentimental and believe more in a &quot;lesser&quot; concept like soulmates than they would ever admit out loud. And then we get to the hotel, just over an hour in. It's an argument full of flaws and passion, and dripping with life. For a movie with essentially five scenes (airport, car, villa, hotel, and waterfront), it's remarkably poignant.</quote>

What a difficult character to portray, and yet despite a fantastic performance, you'll usually never hear his name creep into the conversation about great 21st-century actors.

It's representative outside of the heteronormative which I think in this case is worth mentioning, because it makes it stand out. But at the end of the day, make me laugh. This did, a lot.</quote>

  <quote>On sheer entertainment it doesn't match my other 80-ranked flicks this year, and it doesn't strike me on an emotional level the same way other dramas have done this year. All the same, this is so damn INTERESTING. Only a filmmaker the level of Richard Linklater could pull this off, filming a movie over an 11-year period and not losing an ounce of tone or control. Linklater is a master. This movie lives and dies on relationships, performances, and the spectacular mundane. It's always right now.</quote>

The dual father roles of De Niro and Palminteri play well off each other; the men are similar in perspective despite their different lives. The Bronx's racial divide is handled quite well (though the romance angle is tacked on and drug down by excruciatingly-long slo-mo shots), and everyone played their parts quite well. Definitely a must-see genre flick.</quote>

  <quote>A case-study in the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; theory, it's original and quirky, hilarious in parts, with some pretty memorable performances. A lot of this flick went over my head, not afraid to admit that, and it seemed that some of the characters (ie. McDormand) were written in an extremely linear and one-track way, which hopefully was intended. Ultimately, it's a step down from No Country, which is essentially unavoidable, but this film's merits should NOT be measured against No County's.</quote>

  <summary>Set in 1950s New York, a department-store clerk who dreams of a better life falls for an older, married woman. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>While not as erotically-charged as hoped (and no, that doesn't just mean &quot;more sex scenes!&quot;), and doing a great job of painting almost all of its male characters as repugnant doofuses (while at the same time, fairly accurately depicting strong male sexual insecurity), &quot;Carol&quot; does a commendable job telling its story and evoking its emotions. Rooney and Cate are perfect together, Haynes does an excellent job directing, and the atmosphere of 1950's New York is spot-on. Definitely watch this!</quote>

  <summary>After being kidnapped by two criminals during birth, Chappie becomes the adopted son in a strange and dysfunctional family. Chappie is preternaturally gifted, one of a kind, a prodigy. He also happens to be a robot. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Chappie is, undeniably, an emotionally-gripping story with an incredibly-memorable character. It's both symbolic and quite literal (a &quot;reject&quot; sticker across the forehead) in terms of how it approaches the questions of human acceptance of AI, or anything that may be perceived as &quot;better&quot; than it is. And human cock-baggery. Robot car-jackings may be the best thing ever, even if it's horrible in context. I had concerns about the movie maybe becoming &quot;too action-y&quot;, but it never crossed that line.</quote>

  <quote>I think, two-thirds deep into any given year in film, you really start seeking out the home runs. The flicks that catch you by surprise with how much you enjoy them. Count CRA into that group for me. It diverts in significant ways from the book but, as often happens, that bore no impact on my enjoyment of the film. Really solid performances all-around (Awkwafina is funnier here in her first 2mins of screen time than all of &quot;Oceans 8&quot;). I laughed, I actually teared up; I was invested.

Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo - the fierce rival who became his closest friend. (Rotten Tomatoes)</summary>
  <quote>I feel so bad because I'm doing that thing that you really shouldn't do, and that's compare this movie against what I feel is the best of the franchise (Rocky Balboa). And this movie doesn't HAVE to be that movie, like I've said a dozen times, but Creed just feels... off. It feels rushed if I'm being honest. Stuff isn't given the time I feel it needs or deserves to breathe. Performance-wise, it's great, and the production values are there. I just feel that it pales in comparison to its cousins.</quote>

  <summary>Married, middle-aged and with children is hardly a recipe for romance, but Tina Fey and Steve Carrell are determined to keep the spark alive in this Shawn Levy-helmed comedy about a date night gone horribly awry. Joining Fey and Carrell in this ensemble cast film are Mark Wahlberg, who plays a securities expert, James Franco as a slightly slow con man and Leighton Meester as the couple's babysitter.</summary>
  <quote>I'll pop it to an 80 because this was my first real exposure to Tina Fey; I'm not an SNL fan and I never really followed her stand-up career. So just having her on screen for most of the movie really bumped it up. Throw in brief-but-excellent showings from James Franco, Mark Ruffalo, Mila Kunis, and the ageless wonder Ray Liotta, and another in a string of utterly fantastic performances from Mr. Carell, you have the makings of one of the best comedies since Hangover.</quote>

  <quote>Out-kickasses &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; by a country mile, sporting a much more likable protagonist. You can very obviously tell that this is a Canadian-made movie if you look hard enough. Woody drives the flick, no surprise there, but honestly, Kat Dennings deserves a lot of praise for her work. She's not really given much to work with -- an underwritten hooker character -- but at the same time, she DOES make the most of it. Most criticisms against her acting are bullshit as far as I'm concerned. Recommended!</quote>

I can buy the &quot;surface-level&quot; arguments, and the creation of the script felt rushed, but, it does paint an unflattering picture of the Hollywood machine at times, and there's a bit more depth than maybe it's given credit for, in terms of Wiseau and the cast &amp;amp; crew. Some hyperbole in the ending for sure. This didn't let me down.</quote>

I had hoped ScarJo's character would show ANY development, the dialect is somewhat trying, and the flick ends 8-10 minutes too soon.

Despite the pacing problems, Butterfield's &quot;Ender&quot;, along with pretty realistic performances from kids and adults alike, and the skillfully-displayed (if transparent) theme of war morality pushes this Sci-Fi feature to a high score. Definite recommend.</quote>

  <summary>A lonely middle-aged catering manager (Bob Hoskins) spends all of his time studying tapes of an eccentric TV chef (Arsinee Khanjian). Meanwhile, a young woman (Elaine Cassidy) is making her way from Ireland to find her boy friend (Peter McDonald), who moved to England to get a job in a lawn-mower factory. On arrival, she makes an early contact with the caterer, who recommends a boarding room to her. Slowly, it is revealed that the caterer has in fact befriended and subsequently abused more than a dozen young women. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Require a one-line synopsis of flicks before you watch them? There's this guy. His mommy didn't love him enough. Now he craves the attention of young women, and when they try to leave, he kills them. But there's a lot more to it than that. I look at Felicia as quintessentially naive and innocent. She was played a fool by her &quot;boyfriend&quot; (who fucked and chucked), got knocked up, and in a lot of ways her desires parallel those of the serial killer. Oh, and Catholics are portrayed rather terribly.</quote>

  <summary>A look at the life of the astronaut, Neil Armstrong, and the legendary space mission that led him to become the first man to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Among the more intense in-theater experiences that I can remember. Some will undoubtedly view it as slow, but I was deeply invested in (especially) the second half. Gosling is so damn good, and the way that Chazelle - and his remarkably steady hand - portrays the Moon itself as not only its own character, but indeed as something of an antagonist to Armstrong, was very well executed. My expectations of &quot;good Oscar bait&quot; were replaced with &quot;this is absolutely deserving of the Oscars it WILL win&quot;.</quote>

  <quote>The fact that the real Mark Schultz has completely retconned his opinion of the movie, doesn't change mine. The moments of captivating intensity are possibly spaced too far apart even for my taste (though I have no problem with slow movies), but for a movie that rides its performances so hard, it boasts some truly great ones, whether true-to-life or not. Tatum is severely underrated here while Ruffalo &amp;amp; Carell get most of the fanfare. Justifiably so, as both are tremendous. It's worth the watch.</quote>

But things get complicated when Dylan (inevitably?) falls for his gal pal. Patricia Clarkson co-stars as Jaime's hip mom and Woody Harrelson plays Dylan's practical confidante, who advises him to man up when he pursues the newly dating Jamie.</summary>
  <quote>Been done before? For sure. Been done ALREADY THIS YEAR? Definitely. If you watched &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, you were probably like me and hesitant to watch this movie at all. But y'know, I actually think you're missing out if you pass it by. A constant stream of amazing interconnected one-liners, with great leads and a great supporting cast make it an enjoyable watch. It loses points for a tossed-on (and tossed-aside) dramatic sub-plot, and obnoxiously-long sex scenes, but worth an eventual rent.</quote>

  <summary>This update of the 1985 horror comedy focuses more on terror than laughs when teen Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) suspects that his new neighbor, the sinister Jerry Dandrige (Colin Farrell), is a vampire, and turns to a self-styled vampire expert, Peter Vincent (David Tennant), for help. Las Vegas magician Vincent proves useless, and it's up to Charley to save his mom, Judy (Toni Collette), and girlfriend, Amy, from the seductive bloodsucker.</summary>
  <quote>Pleasantly surprised! I love Imogen Poots, she's gorgeous and actually has acting chops which is nice of course. David Tennant and McLovin' bring the laughs in a big way, and, I can't believe I'm gonna give this to him, but props are due to Colin Farrell. It's a role he gets to have fun with and he very clearly does. He's done some stinkers and been in great movies (typically not great because of him directly, but in them nonetheless). He's quite good here. I feel it does the original justice.</quote>

This is just the movie you go to if you want to laugh, and I did plenty of that. It's a pretty bright script that I actually don't think lost any steam at all. There's a lot of schlock in this genre -- some real unwatchable garbage -- and maybe that skews the rating of it, but Game Night is one of the good ones.</quote>

  <quote>Really genuinely pleased with a movie that I had high expectations for to begin with. I felt that the movie stayed relatively faithful to the source material (whereas its obvious comparative, Gone Girl, dove far off course multiple times). Emily Blunt is, at this point, a modern master craftswoman of her art. She can play anything with believability. Props to Haley Bennett as well!

I'll take how a movie FEELS over so-called objectivity any day, and this movie FEELS awesome. &quot;The Guest&quot; is among the most gloriously-indulgent movies I've seen this year. Awesome stuff!</quote>

  <summary>Laurie Strode comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers, the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I really enjoyed this. While I acknowledge that it isn't on the same atmospheric level as the original, and Laurie is a remarkably poor decision-maker for someone who's been planning this out for 40 years, I just had fun with it. It felt very authentic to the original, the tropes didn't feel as cumbersome as they can sometimes feel in horror movies, I didn't &quot;call&quot; the turn with the doctor's character so that was impactful, and overall this was more than sufficient for me for a Halloween movie.</quote>

  <quote>This will be nothing new to anybody, but, it's better than the second one, just based on it being a different formula within the same construct of &quot;Wolfpack must do X to find/save Doug&quot;. Still not as good as the first one, but, it doesn't have to be. Goodman is awesome; everybody is really on-point, actually. It wasn't as uproariously funny as the first, it packs more laughs than Part 2. Would have liked to have seen more consequence to the guys' actions. But comedy is comedy and this is great.</quote>

  <quote>When you mix the elements of a child assassin, the European aesthetic, and a completely bomb Chemical Brothers soundtrack, you have to work so hard to mess it up. This doesn't. You toss on top of all that goodness, an excellent cast headlined by a more-than-capable Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana and uber-versatile Cate Blanchett, and you have the makings of an absolute blockbuster. The final frame kind of knocks it back a bit, which is unfortunate, but I would love to see more of this character/story.</quote>

  <quote>This is actually the first in the HP series that I've seen, so I have some catching up to do. I only ended up going to it because my friend made me but I was actually very impressed. I have a feeling I will enjoy the latter flicks more than the first few, but I'm not sure. It's a solid flick and a series that gets ragged on probably a lot more than it deserves. As always, films made from a popular book/comic series are always negligible, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.</quote>

  <quote>Had I seen it in time, it would have been comfortably inside my Best of 2016. I certainly see why this was nominated for Best Picture, though I do have to admit that there may not be a standout individual performance in the bunch. Instead, a strong ensemble performance and the thoughtful (if a bit cartoonish at times) treatment of uncomfortable themes and conditions of 1960's America propel it to its excellent score. It may play it safe and fail to break new ground, but it's more than watchable.</quote>

In any case, &quot;Five Armies&quot; does not measure up favorably to any of the Rings movies or its two predecessors. I cannot see my way to ranking it lower than an 80, as ANY trip to Jackson's Middle Earth is one worth taking for me, but the heavy melodrama and odd-feeling choices drag this down. At least the 3D was worthwhile. This is NOT &quot;the defining chapter&quot; of this saga.</quote>

Mockingjay 1 in still in the middle of the HG movies -- it doesn't have the production or pacing issues of the first (despite claims that &quot;nothing happens&quot;, which I think are dumb, and makes me question what movie those people were watching), but it lacks the quality of performance and impact of the second. Truth be told, this one felt a little hammy in spots. But those are minor qualms; it's a good movie. Interesting commentary on the propaganda process. I dug it!</quote>

But the series accomplished what I wanted it to, bringing to life a dark and gritty world, that continually discussed propaganda in an interesting way and made great use of colour (and lack thereof) to convey tone.</quote>

These things are only hinted at in an off-hand manner at best (Theseus not having a father). But. The story is good enough, there's excellent action and again, beautiful visuals.

  <summary>When Tony Stark's world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin, Stark starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's not the first movie. It doesn't have to be, but, it's not. And it's not the second movie but in that case, that's good in that it's better than the second movie by a decent clip. It's as vulnerable as we've ever seen Tony Stark, and the larger role being taken on by Pepper is welcomed. It's a really good villain, and yeah sure there's some silliness involved in giving out ones home address out of a vengeful rage, but that's pretty minor. Ben Kingsley owns. Spirited and entertaining.</quote>

  <summary>Twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise, the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back.</summary>
  <quote>So here's what I feel happened with the early section, which feels rushed: they had a cut of the full movie that was 3h10m long, knew they had to chop 20mins, and took it out of the first hour. After that, this gave me basically what I wanted from the second part, and allowed each character's personal narrative time to breathe. The contrivances and tropes are very forgivable. Skarsgard is still so damn good, and I'm just really happy any time I get to see McAvoy and Chastain on a movie screen.</quote>

  <quote>Once you get it out of your heads that a movie with Zach-G has to be a comedy, and stop being disappointed by the fact that this movie is not trying to be a comedy despite the title, I think your rankings would raise. There ARE some funny parts in there that attempt to save the comedy-philes (&quot;She try and make sex in my bed!&quot;). And typically, dramedies try to push more comedy than drama. It's nice to see things from the other side. So, I'm not with you guys on this one. This movie was excellent.</quote>

  <quote>Much of the early comedy is subtle and understated which here I found to be really effective. It's a feel-good picture that's more of a dramedy than straight comedy, with some real negative undertones, especially in the relationship between Jeff and his mother &amp;amp; Pat and his wife. Ed Helms' delivery is impeccable and so natural, and Segel is no slouch either (an underrated talent). Most scenes with Sarandon are poorly-crafted. The last 25 minutes are very poignant if not a little cheesy. See it!</quote>

  <summary>After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life.</summary>
  <quote>The John Wick movies can best be described as video games. Wick is obviously the player-character. Every single enemy he encounters is significantly weaker than he is, which is why he can beat up many at once. He can take many hits while enemies can only take a few. He faces a few mid-bosses that are a little tougher, before he meets the final boss. This is not a criticism in any way. This is the right way to do these movies. Chapter 2 is equal parts dumb and awesome. See it! Bring on Chapter 3!</quote>

  <quote>Pretty damn fun. Basically everything that I want from this kind of movie. It homages while standing on its own as its own movie, and has lots of entertaining moments both action- and comedy-wise. It includes: Chris Pratt, velociraptors, Chris Pratt riding a motorcycle between four velociraptors, swerves, heel turns, babyface double-turns, and an ending sequence that is unadulterated movie-making fun. It's a tad cheesy, and it doesn't ask much performance-wise, but fan and non should take it in.</quote>

Vaughn is still mostly on-point, and despite lacking the one statement scene (ie. the church in Kingsman 1), from top to bottom, this remains a really good movie with lots of places to go from here for the franchise.</quote>

  <summary>The story of two lighthouse keepers on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A movie that I must begrudgingly admit to respecting more for what it works to be, than enjoying for what it is. I don't question the talent of anyone involved, and there's visual and auditory intrigue for days. I don't know if its inaccessibility or I'm simply not clever enough to fully grasp what the movie wants from me. Now luckily this does crank things up in the back-half, cutting a frenetic pace and pulling this rating out. I wanted to love it, but I liked what I got, all the same.</quote>

  <summary>In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Logan definitely hits you in all the right places on an emotional level: the failing health of the heroes you've loved, the plight of the young mutants who never asked for what's been forced upon them, and the raw anger and vitriol behind the violence. What it accomplishes is what all great &quot;final appearances&quot; should, and that's the knowledge that I never NEED to see those characters again out of some &quot;unfinished business&quot; sentiment. Props to Dafne Keen for our incredible introduction to X-23.</quote>

  <quote>I can't call this as uproariously funny as some of Levine's other productions, nor some of its recent contemporaries that I've given this ranking to (Game Night, Blockers, etc.), but, what I can say is that I enjoyed and will remember more about this movie than most of those others. Walking in with zero expectations, I was treated to a movie of surprising quality; entertaining, with solid storytelling. Cast Charlize Theron in everything, because she can do anything and make you buy into it.</quote>

So far, it's among the year's best.</quote>

  <quote>It's a Guy Ritchie! A solid cast and really good character performances throughout buoys an upstart franchise-maker of a film. It's fun and it's shot/edited in an interesting way. I can see how people could say that everything wraps up pretty abruptly, but to me the brevity of the ending doesn't take away from the pretty excellent journey to get there. I do wish we could have explored the torturer character a little more. What an amazing soundtrack. I definitely want to see more of this team.</quote>

  <quote>To call this movie bombastic would be an overstep, but I can't shake the feeling that this is big and pretty with not a lot of oomph. It started to feel inconsequential.

If this is ultimately convention, it's convention done pretty well, entertaining, and is totally worth seeing on a big screen.

This is a really good movie. Sure there are enough plot twists and swerves to break your neck, but remember that most of them are inconsequential in the end.

  <quote>I totally dug this. I can agree that JGL is perhaps not best-suited to mostly-comedic roles such as this (moreso to roles like 50/50, also directed by Levine, which is the perfect dramedy mix), but in terms of stoner comedies I don't think it's fair to hate on this. Most of the criticisms I've read towards this are not earned. Criticize a movie being cameo-heavy if you must but every single one of them had comedic or narrative impact. For what this movie is TRYING to be, I really enjoyed it.</quote>

He's a product of the environment and he's so goddamn convincing as this scumbag character. He just owns it. I can't tell if this is glorifying nightcrawlers, condemning them, a character study, or just bloody entertaining. Doesn't matter, it's great.</quote>

  <quote>2011's answer to &quot;Going The Distance&quot; for me; a rom-com that I didn't expect to like all that much (due to my majority distaste for Ashton Kutcher), but that I ended up really enjoying. The character of Adam that Kutcher plays is really genuine and one worth investing in. And Natalie is just so fantastic, in each and every scene. Sure it's formulaic, sure it's predictable, sure it's all kinds of cliched and expected. But sometimes, I guess that's okay. No love for rom-coms? You're missing out.</quote>

  <quote>Concerned in the early-going as the acting feels stilted. Not melodramatic, just... stilted. When the novel begins the movie really picks up and becomes interesting. Really, Gyllenhaal is the main attraction and it's his characters, real- and novel-world, that carry the intrigue (along with Michael Shannon). In a sense this is the most crushing aspect of the film, as Gyllenhaal's real-world character can be seen as wholly unsympathetic after the events of what is a pretty great ending. See this!</quote>

  <quote>Give me a seriously-crafted, well-performed dramatization of a previously-unknown-to-me real story, and you'll have me almost every time. This is no different. I can't call this anything less than the best Keira Knightley I've ever seen; even in subtle moments, her facials and body language conveyed a depth of performance I, frankly, wasn't sure she still had in her. Short on excess but with tension and intrigue in spades, it's a significant step up for Gavin Hood from 2015's &quot;Eye In The Sky&quot;.</quote>

  <quote>This sits comfortably between Big Hero 6 and Inside Out for me. While it doesn't reach the emotional highs of some of its contemporaries, the excitement of new, original Disney/Pixar IP is hard to ignore, and I'd be lying if I said that this didn't get to me in a few spots later on. It's an engaging story, wonderfully voice-acted, and even if there might not be other territory to mine in this universe, Scanlon's deeply-personal love letter to the events of his past stands strong on its own.</quote>

  <quote>It doesn't have the same UMPH as the first one, let's get that out there right away. At the same time, re-doing this same idea is still so much better than 90% of the other horror that's out there, it's totally forgivable that the sequel is less atmospheric and arguably cheaper in the way it goes about trying to scare you. I liked the dynamic of the family very much, and I was quite interested in the logic behind the demon's appearance; the first movie just makes it appear a random occurrence.</quote>

There is a very real story behind this flick, for those who are willing to do the research and find out about it.

  <summary>The Passion of The Christ focusses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus has gone to pray after sitting the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death.

  <quote>I was engrossed enough in the characters and aesthetic that the twist escaped me, although this flick admittedly did a good job of hiding it. What I loved about this movie was that it actively tried to send you in a few hundred different directions. It makes you second-guess yourself; it accepts that, as a 21st Century moviegoer, you're trying to &quot;call it&quot;; to get to the end of the flick before the flick does, and it plays directly into that, throwing red herrings at you from start to finish.</quote>

This is a better-than-most comedy that isn't quite up to par, in my opinion, with the other Apatow flicks.  And it's not the best stoner comedy out there, but it's above the curve.  Still, worthy of the 80/100 and a recommended viewing.</quote>

  <quote>In hindsight, I think &quot;Black Pearl&quot; really sets up the rest of the series well, but in a weird way, because at the end of it, if you didn't already know that it was intended to be a trilogy, I don't know if you could tell from the ending that there were definitely going to be more films.  I think there's quite an argument there for this being a stand-alone flick.  Depp is fantastic as always, and Bloom follows the footsteps of Hugo Weaving by doing another big franchise in conjunction with LotR.</quote>

  <quote>The absolute best thing that I can say about this movie is, its social and political relevance makes me glad that it exists. That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy it; I certainly did. I probably could have done without the multitude of scenes of self-important people (usually men) talking over each other, yet understand at the same time that that's the exact message they were going for. It's a quiet, somewhat-poignant, reaffirmation of the sanctity of press freedom, more important now than ever.</quote>

  <quote>I can't be too negative on a movie that is done so well. The film portrays the elements of Precious' life - her Harlem neighborhood, her sexually abusive father, physically and verbally abusive mother, and her vivid imagination and fantasy world - in such a raw and tangible way. The cast does deserve the majority of the respect and esteem that it gets - even though, IMO, certain actors (Mo'Nique) are too overblown to be taken seriously in some instances, but not entirely insincere. A must-see.</quote>

I'm a Criticker pseudo-intellectual who is going to use the next 500 characters to tell you why I thought this musical dramedy flick based on a Tony-nominated musical is bland, generic, cliched, and overwritten, using words like &quot;pathos&quot; to attempt to push myself into pretentious nirvana. Here's the skinny: Rock of Ages is awesome. It's funny, it doesn't try to be anything it isn't supposed to be, the characters and performances fit perfectly, and the music is mostly amazing.

It's better on virtually every level from my perspective, especially the way it's shot -- the use of retrospective &amp;amp; pauses in time were really solid. Neeson + Harris = gold.

  <summary>An other-worldly story, set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1963. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Concept-wise, I was so very down for this, and while I admit that I had precious little idea of what I was really walking into (other than, it's a Guillermo del Toro movie, so I'm going to love it), I have to admit as well that I DON'T love it. This is a good movie, probably very good, with great performances, incredibly sculpted by its director, and I'm hard-pressed to come up with anything about it that I explicitly didn't like. I'm not let down, not by a long shot, but I'm not all in, either.</quote>

  <quote>Soderbergh's psychological drama about a depressed woman, her trials with prescription drugs, and the legal conundrum surrounding &quot;intent&quot; serves as a pleasing first half of what does feel like two movies in one. The film has a perfect tone and perfect pace, as expected it had an original score worth the price of admission alone, has a mostly-satisfying (but most importantly, unpredictable) conclusion, and is buoyed by pitch-perfect performances from Law &amp;amp; Mara. Well worth the investment!</quote>

  <quote>While Skyfall fell victim to one of the same problems I had with QoS - lack of one identified &quot;Bond Girl&quot; - it is in most every other sense a significant upgrade; the action felt more purposeful, the pace was much more suited to James Bond vs. generic action star #431, and the primary villain is not only portrayed by the phenomenal Javier Bardem, but is simply *better*. Would've liked to have seen mention of either Vesper or Mathis. The Bond reboot is moving in the right direction. See Skyfall!</quote>

  <quote>It doesn't need to be said, but, this movie doesn't match up with Super Troopers. But it IS an improvement over their last two outings. MCD is hilarious, Jay Chandrasekhar in particular really shines once again, and while this was certainly a lower-budget effort than their previous works, and again, doesn't stack up to Super Troopers, I don't think the unfavorable reviews I'm seeing here (and from professional critics) are warranted. It's as if lowbrow and slapstick are suddenly bad things.</quote>

And while there are some elements of the story that are clearly melodramatized, it still does an effective job of telling it, and it's an intriguing and supremely relevant story on its own.

  <quote>I don't tire of movies with dystopian and class warfare elements, especially in Sci-Fi, and ESPECIALLY when filmed with style and flair. This accomplishes all of these. Do I think it's a great movie? Not to the extent of others, no. But where the movie really succeeds for me is in its freshness, and its sense of tongue-in-cheek, self-aware, ridiculous fun, underneath its hopeless setting. The screenplay continually improves as the movie moves along. Good performances, bizarre, and worth seeing.</quote>

  <quote>I'm all over this flick in a big bad way. It takes awhile to get going, but once it does, the development of the story of these two aspiring filmmakers (and, in a lot of ways, the development of two &quot;enemies&quot; into two brothers) becomes something beautiful and more. I loved how their friendship not only brought the two of them closer, but also brought them closer with their respective families (one moreso than the other). Another under-the-radar flick that's become a favorite. Glad I took a shot.</quote>

The boxing choreography could have been better but it's classic boxing movie storyline, which I'm all for. But obviously this is more of a character study than a boxing movie (like the latter Rocky movies especially... there I go again). And Gyllenhaal is just so good right now.

  <quote>I'd place Spectre a close #3 in terms of the Daniel Craig Bond movies. It doesn't sniff Casino Royale, but there are certain things that Spectre does better than Skyfall, and vice-versa. Lea Seydoux is wonderful (if a little ineffectual), and I think the best compliment to be paid is, this feels the most &quot;Bond&quot; that Craig has ever felt. If this is indeed the end of Craig's run as 007, it ends on a strong note, as Spectre is both a good movie on its own, and a solid addition to the Bond universe.</quote>

Speaking of Frakes, he has a specific directorial style that really works for me. The DataSex and Zero-G fight are forgivably wonky. I've always loved the Borg/Moby Dick metaphor.

Starting around &quot;Stardust City Rag&quot;, the first season of &quot;Picard&quot; grows into a worthy successor to the greatest Sci-Fi series of all-time, even if its highest moments don't sniff the same quality or depth of storytelling as its parent show. It's TNG for a modern audience, and given that actual TNG would be lost on that audience, I'll certainly take this, though I understand if you're divided on the finale.</quote>

  <quote>NANOMACHINES! The Terminator franchise's answer to &quot;how do we do what X-Men did and retcon the stuff that nearly killed us?&quot; And by &quot;stuff that nearly killed us&quot;, I mean everything since T2. Yeah, they totally cop out at the end, on a number of aspects (because let's face it, folks, there's gonna be sequels), and this is a textbook example of &quot;the trailer gives away too much&quot;, but it was pretty enjoyable for what it's trying to be, even if the mythology is awfully convoluted at this point.</quote>

  <summary>Interviews, rehearsals and backstage footage of Michael Jackson as he prepared for his series of sold-out shows in London.</summary>
  <quote>I think this was ultimately more suited as a movie-theater experience rather than an at-home experience. This would have been an epic show, and the grandiosity of the spectacle on film lived up to the master's vision. Unfortunately, I feel as though this film will never live down the notion of &quot;cashing in&quot; on MJ's death, and maybe that's a legit criticism (not so much of the film itself but of its mere existence). Shows yet another side of the charismatic enigma that was Michael Jackson. RIP.</quote>

  <quote>Stands mostly shoulder-to-shoulder with the 2006 feature. It went back to some of the &quot;guerrilla&quot; style cinematography (not necessarily always polished), the jokes were hilarious and fresh (a credit to taking five years off between pictures), the three schemes didn't interfere with each other or bog the movie down, and most importantly, Bubbles stopped being the primary focus of the movie (which I felt really hurt TPB2 &amp;amp; season 7 of the show). This makes me want to see seasons 8 and 9 even more.</quote>

  <quote>I don't think the first 15 minutes of a movie has ever confused me this much and drawn me all at once. I mean I know what's going on but everything is so surreal, and it's filmed and presented in this cool retro way, with the camerawork and ambient soundtrack; it sets a real atmosphere which I think is probably vital to a film like this. This director doesn't work very much (3 features in 14 years) but establishes a style here that really makes his movie stand out. Slow, but worth experiencing.</quote>

  <quote>There are many elements here that make me potentially like this movie, as a whole, more than &quot;Get Out&quot;. Peele is transfixed on his ideas and concepts, sometimes sacrificing the coherent telling of the story, which can be both a criticism and praise. One thing though that I undisputedly love  are Peele's more-than-occasional scenes of absolute visual brilliance. The underground facility might be my favorite sequence of 2019.

  <quote>It's a movie that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is -- a small, character-driven, three-person world that sucks you in to it and refuses to let go. The risk being that, you have to have characters and actors that are capable of pulling that off. Luckily, the three leads are truly remarkable. It's continuing proof that K-Stew is willing to go wherever she needs to go in order to be taken seriously outside of the Twilight franchise, and she is more than deserving of that credibility.</quote>

  <quote>Entertaining in an &quot;I would never do any of these things, but it's fun to watch others do them&quot; kind of way.

Debatable - there are consequences (though the severity is questionable, as the movie alludes). It's pretty clear that Belfort is a total dick, but the movie leaves it up to the audience whether his redeeming qualities outweigh that. See it!</quote>

  <quote>It's such a cool and unique concept, helped along by a big nostalgic push from seeing some classic video game characters (good bad or indifferent) licensed in new ways. The voice acting is pretty good as far as I'm concerned (Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman are particularly fantastic). It's a fairly smart script (the line &quot;What's going on in this candy-coated Heart of Darkness?&quot; is brilliant) and a nice, engaging story that's not too taxing. It's charming and enjoyable, if not spectacular.</quote>

The duo works together to stop a powerful adversary that threatens mankind, but their ideological differences drive them apart and turn them into ferocious enemies.</summary>
  <quote>Not breaking any new ground in saying this, but McAvoy and Fassbender are head and shoulders the major reason for watching this movie and recommending that others watch it. As a History nerd, the Cold War backdrop is always a draw and it's pulled off here with a decent sensitivity for accuracy. Not being a big connoisseur of the comics, it's hard for me to comment on character accuracy, but it worked well enough for me. I will say that there was some dialogue wonk.

  <quote>It's a modern take on an 80's slasher flick, right down to the musical choices, which are somewhat ADHD -- at times brilliant, at times unfitting.

Simplistic motivations, sometimes-challenging visuals, and a not-quite-fleshed-out backstory are wholly forgivable against this excellently-executed treat.</quote>

  <quote>Any movie that kicks off with talk of occultism and the multiverse theory has to be at least a little okay! I admit that in the early going, even for someone like me with limited anime culture knowledge, the movie feels generic; spots that I've seen before. Luckily it breaks from this pretty quickly and what unfolds is pretty enjoyable, and then holy shit did that ever get dark. Eventually I found myself really captivated by the beauty and emotion of the story. Slow burn to an excellent watch.</quote>

  <quote>It's totally still a good time and comparable to the first one. There are still good jokes, still good character relationships, and the self-awareness smattered throughout is welcomed. It's a straight comedy with, once again, a touch of sentimentality, which at its highest highs is extremely funny while never really dipping into that &quot;going too far&quot; or &quot;trying too hard&quot; area for me. It's almost &quot;literally the same thing&quot;, but it's very worth seeing if you're looking for a fun time at the movies.</quote>

  <quote>I think I liked this maybe a bit more than my average 75, but, I'm tempering my score because this strikes me as a movie that might not age well for me. Plummer is great, but I'm afraid I don't quite get the hype for Michelle Williams. Ridley Scott probably doesn't deserve the Best Director nom(s) he's getting for this, but for the name and the fact that he pulled off the Herculean task of re-shooting an entire primary character in a few weeks. I dug this for sure, though. Intriguing story.</quote>

  <quote>I somewhat lamented the re-boot of the Spider-Man series, even though I mostly disliked the third movie. As far as whether I &quot;prefer&quot; this version of the story to the Raimi version, I dunno, I guess. I do prefer Gwen Stacy and think that Emma Stone has done more with Gwen in one movie than Kirsten Dunst did with Mary-Jane Watson in three. Apparently this version is more canon than was Raimi's, I don't know but I will take people's word for it. I liked the Jekyll &amp;amp; Hyde aspect of Lizard. See it!</quote>

  <quote>The individual performances were quite good, although (somewhat unfortunately) Russell Crowe's characters, performances, etc., are becoming so predictable for me, I can almost sit there and predict lines - see State of Play. But it's a strong movie in and of itself, and the time in History in which it's set makes it all the more interesting for me. I have a soft spot for both Crowe and Denzel Washington - and any time I get to see Josh Brolin on screen, it's a good day.</quote>

By being as light-hearted as it is (while still having some minor sense of stakes and risk), I feel it strikes a good-enough balance between storytelling and purely-popcorn entertainment. The fact that it's given a &quot;Hollywood shine&quot; in terms of not sticking completely to the facts doesn't bother me at all; there are plenty of documentaries on the Medellin and Iran-Contra; seek them out. Just enjoy a kinetic, entertaining movie.</quote>

  <quote>Cinematically this is a master class in really interesting, narrative visuals. I can get into movies like this that ask so many questions and offer up answers very slowly. While not a film that makes multiple viewings the most desirable -- despite probably commanding them -- it's worth your while to watch once for pleasure, and at least once more for a deeper understanding of just exactly what the hell you witnessed. Not the movie of the year, but, should keep you thinking long after the fact.</quote>

  <summary>A woman discovers that severe catastrophic events are somehow connected to the mental breakdown from which she's suffering. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This is an interesting one. It kicks off as a slow drama exploring the effects of alcoholism on one character, branching out to revolve around multiple characters in a Sci-Fi mystery... still exploring alcoholism. Might be the most original thing I've seen all year. Investing performances from Hathaway and Sudeikis - the latter of whom has a satisfying arc into a total sociopath. He is genuinely unsettling in the film's back-half. The black comedy was hit-and-miss but this is worth the watch!</quote>

  <quote>It sets a mood, no question about it. I have to say that I love this cast, it's one of the main things that attracted me to the movie in the first place. That, and I love the whole &quot;disease outbreak&quot; storyline. I think I could have done without the severe body-spasming that accompanied the infection, it kind of distracted me and took me a little out of my suspension of disbelief, and... a fuckin' lottery, really... but that's quite forgivable. For the ambiance alone, it's more than worth seeing.</quote>

  <quote>Very satisfied with my viewing experience here. This flick deviates from the 1973 original in more than a few places, but this modern re-telling of the story worked for me. I didn't particularly enjoy the mundane Hollywood &quot;leaving-the-door-open-for-a-sequel&quot; ending, and there were certain parts that were removed from the original (a father having sex with his daughter, an infected priest burning himself, etc.) that I think should have been brought over. But overall, a great effort from Eisner.</quote>

  <quote>Aside from any of the aesthetics of the movie, I appreciated that this was a sequel that did not demand its audience to be authoritative experts on the original. It gave enough background information that you could even come into it cold and know what's going on. Rebecca Ferguson stands out in a big way and was as compelling to me as McGregor, and shout out Cliff Curtis for solid work, too. Satisfyingly dark throughout. For walking in with little expectation, I have to say: pleasantly surprised.</quote>

Formula done well can be good on its own. Costner's character got a little annoying during the sub-plot with his mother. The intrigue of the movie really lays within the &quot;trailer story&quot; (the story of the actual draft itself), as well as the back-stories of the prospects. I have to admit, I was hooked.</quote>

  <quote>Doesn't blow me away as a complete movie, but it's an experience at the same time that should not be missed on a big screen. It would be fair to describe the movie as vociferous: it's incredibly loud and places you right in the middle of things at all times, employing sound as the primary narrative. No standout performances, just an adequate ensemble. Technically brilliant as always. Not the most fun you'll have at the movies this weekend, nor is it it's own best version. But it's worth seeing.</quote>

  <quote>This movie is kind of preachy. Know that going in. It's very specific in its message on war morality, which is neither a good nor a bad thing. It has, at times, rather narrow and wooden points of view, taking one specific forced jab at stereotypical American apathy. But there is a lot to love about this, and a lot of that is Alan Rickman, who is the focal point of much of the film's black comedy. Maybe more finger-pointy than it need be. Rickman's last line slaughtered me. Worth checking out.</quote>

That's what this movie is: conventional storytelling done very well.

I was upset with perceived bad writing as the ending unfolded, before remembering this was a true story. Whoops!</quote>

  <quote>I enjoyed this! It strongly pulls off the gritty, all-encompassing atmosphere that it was going for, and from a performance standpoint, I don't think Brad Pitt has ever been better, to say nothing of the oft-criticized LaBeouf who, say what you will about him, can bring it in the right role. Calling these characters &quot;heroes&quot; is a misnomer (note: I feel the film addresses this), but that's not a criticism. Even if the &quot;realism&quot; doesn't hit perfectly for you, you can definitely enjoy &quot;Fury&quot; as-is.</quote>

  <quote>A quirky, off-beat little comedy that, had it not been so charming, I don't think I would have enjoyed it nearly as much. There is plenty of fresh, understated comedy to be found, and at times, the characters (many of whom are not particularly well-crafted but don't necessarily NEED to be) walk a fine line between lovable cause-fighters and reprehensible liars. This is particularly true of Murray (Gleeson), who has some brilliant moments. The movie is unpolished, but undeniably captivating.</quote>

  <quote>I have to admit that I'm shocked that the reviews on this movie aren't filled with typical war-movie-review cliches like &quot;jingoistic&quot; and &quot;propagandizing&quot;. Good job, folks. This was rather well done I thought! There are a few moments where the CG or green-screening gets a little amateurish, but this is filled by a great ensemble performance, tells a riveting story, and while it may not show a lot of the other side, what it does show is done with a steady hand. Very worth seeing on a big screen.</quote>

  <quote>The movie, of course, suffers from predictability. Make no mistake - it's the *exact same* formula as the first movie. But quite frankly, if you went into this thinking it was going to be a whole whack different than the first movie, that's your fault. Don't blame the movie. While it IS the exact same movie (essentially) in a different setting... the same conventions and the same gags still work, mostly because we love the characters. While it did lack the same magic, in the end, it still works.</quote>

  <quote>Wow! Guys. Where is the crowd that appreciated the first Scary Movie as really excellent spoof of the most popular cookie-cutter horror flicks of the day, because to be perfectly honest, this is almost as good as the first Scary Movie flick, which I personally thought was fantastic. The jokes were funny and fresh, and while a lot of the humor is crude, for this style, it really works. This is a great return to form for Marlon Wayans, who arguably hadn't made a great movie in a decade.</quote>

As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Gotta go a bit against the grain here. Disney-Pixar isn't AUTOMATICALLY money, and being perfectly honest, &quot;Inside Out&quot; is FAR from my favorite Disney-Pixar creation, much less my favorite kids movie ever or even among the best movies I've seen this year. That said, there's a lot to like! The animation is unbelievable. It's got a good message behind it. The climactic scenes have immense emotional depth. And if it truly does help a younger audience understand themselves better, more power to it!</quote>

  <quote>Buoyed by a really good cast, this struck me as much more entertaining than my expectations (and the trailer) led me to believe! Everybody in this is good-to-very-good; I say that backed up by the knowledge that every character &amp;amp; performance OWNED the fact that this is intentionally campy. Due to that fact, it won't be everybody's cup of tea, but it was definitely mine. I really liked that this not only represented several pre-existing fairy tales, but became a solid fairy tale in and of itself.</quote>

  <quote>I loved the first movie. I love Robert Downey. And I think John Favreau has an awesome directorial vision for the franchise, as well as his character. BUT. They fucked up War Machine. If you're going to introduce War Machine, do so in a way that really embellishes him as, well, a war machine! He should have single-handedly taken on the drones, instead of a team effort with Iron Man. And Iron Man should have gone one-on-one with Whiplash. Enjoyable watch, but, did not meet my lofty expectations.</quote>

  <quote>The flick is visually interesting with some grit to match. The dichotomy between the awoken world and the dream world was equally interesting, but that doesn't automatically make a *great* movie. Performances are fine, direction is probably above-average for the genre. I think this is a good movie that doesn't necessarily take that next step, or break much new ground. But it does take a pretty beneficial psychological turn at the halfway mark, and the darker the movie gets, the better it is.</quote>

  <quote>Haha, &quot;offing her male classmates&quot;. Get it? HANDJOB JOKE! Entertaining campy movie, and I like Diablo Cody; she manages to find something of a useful fit with her dialogue into this style of flick. Granted, it doesn't work like it worked in Juno - and often pushed past campy, into being worthy of ridicule. But I cannot, in good conscience, give a movie involving Meghan Fox making out with Amanda Seyfried anything less than a 75. I don't think Fox had to fly, though. Never trust Indy Rock bands.</quote>

Karen Gillan is a superstar waiting to happen, and Danny GD Devito steals, literally, every single scene he is in. Cast him in every movie as the disgruntled grandpa. You're welcome.</quote>

  <quote>I can't see where the hate is coming from. It was a good enough story with what I thought was really good acting from everyone involved (getting that &quot;underrated&quot; vibe from Sam Worthington, and Elizabeth Banks is a real shining star who's been in a lot of movies but isn't the most recognizable face out there). I love Ed Harris and am always happy to see him. I do have to criticize parts of the ending scenes, especially Worthington's leap of faith off a 25-storey building. That was pretty cheesy.</quote>

  <quote>Minorly-misleading marketing aside, this is a pretty good movie. It at the same time caricatures the so-called &quot;TV finance wiz&quot; while at the same time gloriously personifies the deep seeds of frustration and anger at the world of personal and high finances. Clooney is as good as I've seen him in a long time, ditto for Roberts, and Jack O'Connell is his usual excellent self. There's a moment of Jodie Foster being Jodie Foster-y in there but for the most part, this is clean and well-made. See it!</quote>

  <quote>Wow - I have the highest score so far! Do I win a prize? I have to express what an utter surprise this was for me; I walked in with expectations of disliking a movie that shouldn't be taking itself seriously but is, and walked out with the experience of having watched a lighthearted movie that nonetheless compelled me to buy into its universe. This has given me hype for the Dark Universe, which I fear has a very real chance of letting me down from here. On its own, this is really a lot of fun.</quote>

  <quote>What's more important, style or substance? Movies like this test you as a critic. The lines about Billy raping the 16-year-old and his mother defending it, for instance, balance a treacherous line between compelling and stupid. What's great is, Refn does that completely intentionally, and borders on being a master. The movie's intense, violent and creepy, and while it isn't &quot;Drive&quot;, it doesn't have to be. Much of Refn's substance IS his style, which will rub some the wrong way. &quot;Y'wanna fight?&quot;</quote>

  <quote>I made the mistake of seeing this movie AFTER Dinner For Schmucks, and I couldn't help but compare one to the other, and where DFS was clearly the superior comedy, it might hurt the rating. I'm not a Ferrell fan (he has one character that he plays in EVERY movie), but I have to say, he did enough to make me laugh. Luckily, he was COMPLETELY OUTSHONE by Wahlberg. A criticism is that the roles for Jackson and Johnson are markedly brief, and Riggle/Wayans didn't do it for me. Also, fuck Capitalism.</quote>

  <quote>The movie is tonally interesting because it crosses between psychological thriller and what at times feels like a weird Woody Allen style Parisian love letter. Not really a criticism, just a feature. When the movie is tense, it does so very well, and on tone alone, it's very watchable. Add to that the nuanced narrative, and the &quot;Who's doing what?&quot; elements (yes, plural), you have what amounts to what may not be the best movie of the year, but likely the one that keeps you thinking the longest.</quote>

  <quote>I don't think I see here as much as others do, with the anti-war sentiment. I know it's THERE, I just don't think it goes far enough. But European cinema will always dominate contemporary Hollywood on movies like this. Could be that it's based around a war that few people outside Russia even know existed (War in Chechnya, 12/94-08/96), just doesn't have the same pop as, say, Vietnam. The interplay between the four, I would argue, &quot;main&quot; characters (Sacha, Vanya, Dina, and Hasan) makes the flick.</quote>

  <summary>A group of teens discover secret plans of a time machine, and construct one. However, things start to get out of control. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Marter, gotta disagree with that review, sir! While I'm sure there will be slow moments for some, the movie takes a somewhat-practical approach to time travel (that being, short periods of time vs. &quot;I'm going back to the 40's to kill Hitler&quot;), and the handi-cam filming style is approached in a logical (if a little cornily-direct) way (&quot;From now on, you film everything&quot;). I found this interesting, certainly enough that it kept my attention. It didn't set the world on fire, but I did enjoy it.</quote>

  <quote>At the outset the movie starts setting itself up very similarly to Knives Out, with snappy dialogue and intrigue. Now to be fair, there's an unfortunately-simple &quot;out clause&quot; to the family's insanity, which is, don't get married, maybe? Oh right but &quot;there are rules&quot; and &quot;you would have left if I hadn't proposed within 18 months&quot;. I mean, it's just a little unsatisfying is all, even though there is more than enough entertainment to be found throughout. I just can't truly say that I loved it.</quote>

  <quote>This was about 500% more naked Jennifer Lawrence than I expected to see. That's a feature, not a complaint. I think I under-appreciate spy thrillers. Red Sparrow is uncomfortable in a number of places, but I mean that in a good way; those scenes have impact. J-Law's one scene in particular where she &quot;takes power&quot; from a fellow recruit is her ultimate badass moment in this movie. Some accents were much worse than others. Give me a good story that is also erotically charged, you have my attention.</quote>

I will, however, re-iterate my complete disdain, as a matter of principle, for teenage dialogue no matter how realistic it might be. Michael Parks' dialogue throughout is absolutely gripping and commands attention. I also absolutely lost it at the &quot;simple just shit itself&quot; line.

  <summary>Despite his conviction that demonic possession is just so much supersitious mumbo jumbo, Catholic priest-in-training Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) journeys to Rome to attend a special exorcism school being taught at the Vatican. Before long, true-believer Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins) introduces the young cleric to the devil's power firsthand.</summary>
  <quote>I find myself wondering how many people picked up on the subtle wordplay used to counteract those who would yell foul at the &quot;true events&quot; angle. The movie is inspired by a book, that was inspired by true events, and the movie does say that, but does a great job of masking it. It's an inspiration piece, not a re-telling of true events. I really enjoyed it, it's hard not to enjoy Anthony Hopkins. Has some flawed dialogue and cheap scares, but very enjoyable and great at what it's meant to be.</quote>

  <quote>There are very few personalities, even in an industry as eclectic (and often flamboyant) as the music industry, where this jukebox musical fantasy-style biopic would work. Elton John is one of them. It feels very honest, which sounds weird given the descriptors I used above. As with all biopics, I'm sure it omits (due in no small part to the time period it features), but that's a genre downfall that I won't hold against this movie specifically. Taron Egerton is so damn good. Impeccable casting.</quote>

  <summary>Based on legendary science-fiction author Philip K. Dick's own experiences, A Scanner Darkly tells the darkly comedic, caustic, but deeply tragic tale of drug use in the modern world.  The film plays like a graphic novel come to life with live-action photography overlaid with an advanced animation process -- a method known as interpolated rotoscoping, first employed in writer/director Richard Linklater's 2001 film &quot;Waking Life&quot; -- to create a haunting version of America, seven years from now.   (Warner Independent Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>Honestly, I thought this movie was really really funny. The black comedy elements are just astounding. The whole cast give solid to great performances with deliciously-insane dialogue.

There's room for this in the lexicon of this genre, but I can't say that I particularly loved it. Worth checking out.</quote>

  <quote>&quot;SwearNet&quot; is such an interesting premise for a movie -- a film adaptation of a real-life website/concept, by guys who play eccentric characters but who are also eccentric &amp;amp; dynamic people on their own.

I found the same heart &amp;amp; substance that makes me love &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;. Slow in places, but uproariously funny.</quote>

  <quote>Remember folks, there are two very distinct Seth MacFarlane's. There's the GOOD Seth MacFarlane that we see in the first &quot;Ted&quot;, and then there's the Seth MacFarlane whose comedy overstays its welcome. &quot;Ted 2&quot; (quite literally) tapdances that line, but I still consider it to be a solid comedy worth seeing. There were enough laughs to keep it going for me, though one portion does drag the momentum just a bit. All told, if you dug the first one, you're likely to dig this one as well.

  <quote>Thor has to be the Avenger with the thickest mythology, and it hits you with the mythology of the Nine Realms fast and furiously from the start.

  <quote>I liked this! It's a bit on the heavy-handed and ham-fisted side in the third act, but I think forgivably so; it certainly doesn't tank the movie by any stretch, though it does shift the tone a bit in a way that may kinda lose the younger audience (which was sizable at my particular viewing). Surprising to me that this was Britt Robertson, who I only know as the chick from &quot;The Longest Ride&quot;, who at 25 is a pretty convincing teenager. I never found myself bored or unengaged.

  <quote>Sensory cinema, which I dig, to the point that trying to put this flick into words is almost betraying its spirit, but the average movie-goer will feel taxed, likely beyond their ability to cope. Absolutely gorgeous, organic imagery, but sadly I did not connect with it as others obviously have. I fear I'm missing quite a bit. The second half had some genuine terror and I thought was the stronger of the &quot;dual film&quot;, but understand that the two stories mirror each other (through different lenses).</quote>

It's a movie that has the ability to polarize (as in, is he justified in doing what he's doing if it gets to the truth, which is a pertinent question), and you're left with a watchable flick to back that up.</quote>

  <quote>There's just something about this movie that does it for me; Sci-Fi flicks admittedly have to work a lot harder to disappoint me than to entertain me.  Some people call this movie Tom Cruise's personal moralistic sounding board, but I don't agree with that.  And even if it is, I still consider it a strong cautionary tale about our ability as humans to &quot;suppose social invincibility&quot; once we get ahead in life.  And of course, Cruise is amazing. He tends to do that.</quote>

  <quote>You've going to be of two schools of thought about this one. Either you can accept that this movie isn't about &quot;strict tournament rules about zombies&quot; and that some (okay, a lot of) creative liberties are taken with zombie capabilities and mannerisms, or you can't accept that. If you can't, well, this is gonna be a rough ride for you. If you can, chances are you'll enjoy what is a fun, warm, comical and well-executed dramedy. More than worth taking a chance on; better than expected for sure.</quote>

  <quote>I think the best recent example I can think of that matches this movie tonally would be The Babadook. This one's a slow burn for its entire runtime, with escalating tension and dread, steeped in symbolism. Given its basis in 17th century folk tales, the characters can be forgiven for being fairly archetypal and wooden (hell, you get that in characters TODAY). If you're a tone junky like me, you'll find a lot to like here, even if it doesn't stick with you long-term. Check this one out for sure!</quote>

If anything, everyone in this movie is too... balanced. That sounds weird, but things end VERY conveniently. You're allowed to do dirty conflict in kids movies. Love the narrative style.</quote>

But at the same time, we had a solid, dependably-scary horror flick, with forgivable omissions and lapses in common sense, up until the total cop-out of  an ending. Here's hoping that the sequel can deliver where the original falls short.</quote>

  <quote>It's worth seeing in theatres. I'll say that. It tackles the idea of determinism vs. free will and attempts to make a point, but does so on a fairly shallow level I suppose. I thought the performances were on-point enough and the source material (The Philip K. Dick short story) is really wonderful. There's some tension to be found but it's not the thriller-y action-ish movie that the trailer sort of makes it seem. There's some real beauty if you want to look for it, but some real wonk there too.</quote>

I'm also a big Justin Long fan, and it doesn't hurt that, even though she's supposed to be dead (or is she?), Christina Ricci spends much of the movie naked. Points. There's some pseudo-horror wonk to be found; a couple of scenes are a little too &quot;what the fuck?&quot; for my taste. At its core, a slow-built, creepy, cerebral flick that falls a bit short of greatness. Worth seeing, though.</quote>

  <quote>As I said to my friend who I watched this with, I need to sit down and find a website that shows the entire &quot;Alien&quot; franchise universe timeline in chronological order, because I'm just not steeped enough in it to really know whether this holds up story-wise or not. Visually speaking I thought it was solid (a tip of the cap to what appeared to be 9 million VE artists) and Fassbender is, unsurprisingly, spellbindingly good. This is a good time for the most part, though admittedly drags in places.</quote>

  <quote>A visual upgrade, but a downgrade execution-wise. I enjoy Garfield's take on the character, but sometimes find his goofy schtick overdone. They treated the end of Gwen's story arc properly and with a darker edge than the rest of the flick would suggest (which can be both good and bad, as you'd like to see a consistent tone throughout). Electro's personality and motivations baffle me a bit. Feels like some trailer material was cut from the final film. It's a mixed bag, but see it if you're a fan.</quote>

  <quote>The original teaser for this flick set my expectations EXTREMELY high. Nevermind that it's Eastwood directing, and nevermind that it's Bradley Cooper, who has had a pretty good last couple of years in my opinion. The portions depicting actual combat are the ones that are the most well-done. The portions of the film depicting Kyle's home life are... a bit rushed, I guess. Too much tends to happen in too little time, especially early on. I guess that's the point. Very watchable, if unspectacular.</quote>

  <quote>It's definitely a guilty pleasure. AvP is by no means a GOOD movie, but it's another one of those examples of &quot;What are you expecting to see?&quot;. If you go into this movie and try to judge it on its acting and performances, well, you're setting yourself up for failure because it's not that kind of movie. But if you do into this wanting to (basically) shut your brain off, not care much about the story, and just see two quintessential sci-fi badasses go toe to toe, well, I think you can enjoy it.</quote>

  <quote>One thing you can always say about Korine, he's gonna establish tone and stick to it. I did enjoy most of the performances; obviously McConaughey is the standout. There's a psychological dissatisfaction with the mere fleeting moments of consequence in the movie held up against all of Moondog's negative actions, but I mean at the end of the day, it's a stoner fantasy, and it works better for me personally to believe that everything beyond a certain point is either hallucination or a coma dream.</quote>

I rather enjoyed myself, and I think I'm growing increasingly &quot;forgiving&quot; (read: tolerant) of religiously-themed cinema.

  <quote>I truly wanted to believe I was witnessing something special. Perhaps it got so thick and convoluted that I simply couldn't keep pace. Patterson's performance is... uneven to me. At times excellent, at times simply &quot;too&quot; stoic and stone-faced (undoubtedly done intentionally, but not so that it makes it any better or more palatable). I argue that the supporting cast almost all outperform R-Patz. The first half is VERY heavily seasoned with political &amp;amp; economic theories. Very solid ending though.</quote>

  <summary>A lawyer finds himself in over his head when he gets involved in drug trafficking.</summary>
  <quote>&quot;The Counselor&quot; is not the kind of movie you see if you don't want to think. That's the best way I can put it. The story is non-linear and unclear to put it mildly, you're kinda dropped in the middle of it to begin with, but some of the performances are such treats. Really, everyone is great, but you have to pay SUCH close attention to the dialogue. And it's a dialogue-heavy movie to boot. It's taxing on its audience, but the individual performances make it worth seeing, possibly more than once.</quote>

  <quote>I can't say that I blame you if you don't really know what to do with this movie. You should start by accepting that Gore Verbinski is just kinda weird. Unquestionably talented, but, just a little on the strange side. This hits the atmosphere just perfectly and is often as cerebral and creepy as I'd hoped it would be. A time or two it arguably takes this too far and becomes less accessible to the audience in the process. Filmed beautifully and totally worth checking out. Perhaps more than once.</quote>

  <quote>I haven't read the books; I think that's probably beneficial, in so much as you can take this just as its own movie and not worry so much about the politics of source faithfulness. People are at the same time decrying this as generic and incoherent, which are basically polar opposites in this context. It's not incoherent; it's a linear storyline that we've actually seen hundreds of times. Nobody kills it performance-wise but Elba and McConaughey are both fine. I enjoyed it, but what do I know?</quote>

  <quote>Thanks Obby! :) I appreciated this movie as a story of a young girl who has no idea what she wants, but, it WAS all over the place. Seducing her teacher was all about challenging herself out of boredom. But then, she finds she wants something normal for a girl her age. Just so happens that her teacher's a mental patient who breaks down when she breaks up with him, aaand there's a serial killer and an industrial fire. Which I think is a shot at symbolism, but... I dunno. You should see it though!</quote>

  <quote>Best I can tell, one of the movie's primary messages is that Orthodox Jews are kind of pricks when it comes to ways of thinking and living that go against theirs. I don't know if that's intentional, but it's there. I'm left wishing that the chemistry and relationship between Weiss and McAdam felt more like real people experiencing these things, and not actresses portraying them. There was an undercurrent of inauthenticity there that I couldn't shake. Worth a watch, but I admit, I hoped for more.</quote>

  <quote>I sadly feel that this is one of the weaker entries in the MCU. One thing I think the movie does really well is, it's tight; there are very few scenes, if any, that feel like unimportant filler. The visual effects are, of course, unbelievable, and this was absolutely worth seeing in 3D. I love Tilda Swinton, but she is miscast. So is Cumberbatch. And it has less to do with whitewashing and more to do with performance. Theirs are fine, but I hoped for different/more. Victim of high expectations.</quote>

The ending of the movie didn't give me what I was looking for (which is more my fault than the movie's fault, I accept that); I felt that everything about the ending fell together a little too easily.

  <quote>While I think the movie is guilty of some bias here and there, of leaving multiple themes and threads un- or under-explored (likely for the sake of pacing), and goes out with an absolute whimper of an ending, it's a solid and enjoyable watch! Woody steals absolutely every second of screen time he's given and has the best one-liners in the whole movie. This movie, in reflection of its protagonist, may not do any one thing spectacularly well, but taken as the sum of its parts, it's quite good.</quote>

I can't help comparing the flick to District 9 because of its director and similar subject matter (segregation), but where that aspect is really fleshed-out and deep in D9, here it feels secondary to the action and clearly-larger SFX budget. Make no mistake, Elysium is very action-y. I also found myself distracted by the constant camera movement.</quote>

Kind of nice to see de Niro almost parody himself, I got a great kick out of virtually all of his scenes, ESPECIALLY his quiet, introspective moments. It's a family of intelligent badasses, and while I personally maybe could have done without the melodramatic subplot with the daughter and the student-teacher, it's not nearly enough to tank the flick. It's teenagers, it happens. See it!</quote>

  <summary>To push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community. But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the others, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.</summary>
  <quote>I've concluded that, unless these COMPLETELY shit the bed, they're going to be 70's from me, which is a good watch. Of the previous, I said, &quot;...you have to gobble [these] up like cotton candy ... forget that it's not real food ... enjoy the sugary goodness.&quot; That's pretty much true here, too. The Purge movies always do a pretty alright job of sliding some commentary in there with the violence; once again, money is the enemy, and I'm down for that. Could have been more, but what it was is fine!</quote>

  <summary>A comedy that charts the ups and downs of an engaged couple's relationship. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I liked it, it had laughs even though I felt like it drug on far too long. At some point, I found myself no longer endeared by the quirks of the two leads, but rather repelled. The charm of their relationship wore off on me a lot quicker than I had expected/hoped it would. Luckily, a good supporting cast and a very strong (although slightly cop-out-ish) ending saved it for me. Coming down to personal preference, though, I prefer my rom-coms to be more balanced. This felt too jokey, too comedic.</quote>

  <quote>Huh. I have to say, I'm pretty surprised at the negative reception to this. I rather enjoyed myself. This isn't some kind of modern masterpiece, nor is it trying to be, and even though I understand some of the things that weren't exactly great about it, they don't nearly tank my viewing experience like they seemed to for others. I think this is just trying to be a modern remake of a recognizable older movie, and I was entertained and invested in what I saw. You could do worse this weekend.</quote>

His relentless search to find the terrorists leads to a cat-and-mouse conflict with a British government official Hennessy, whose own past may hold the clues to the identities of the elusive killers. (en.wikipedia.org)</summary>
  <quote>This is pretty much a success across the board! Chan is tremendously sympathetic throughout. Brosnan's &quot;laying-it-on-a-bit-too-thick&quot; Irish accent was at least a little distracting to me, and the way it portrays the IRA isn't exactly flattering - not that it has to be. Not an award-winner by any stretch, but proof that Chan can still get it done between the cuts. This is worth checking out, even if it may not stick with you for too long afterwards. You could definitely do worse this weekend.</quote>

  <summary>Set in Boston in 1978, a meeting in a deserted warehouse between two gangs turns into a shootout and a game of survival. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I like the aesthetic well enough and the dialogue is pretty clever and quick-witted, especially in the early going. Maybe the initial shootout would have a little more purpose and gravitas were it not the idiot pawns that were the crux of the whole thing, but once the mid-shootout happens and the dark comedy kicks into full gear, this unfolds as a pretty enjoyable watch! Not the funniest comedy or the goriest/most violent shootout, but a very good combination of both. Totally worth checking out!</quote>

  <quote>Marter's right -- this is DEFINITELY the best of this franchise. But not necessarily for the reasons you might think. This is not a GOOD movie... it's an entertaining movie, and it's super-entertaining, even for folks like me that aren't into two-hour-long car commercials. For a good long while, it's maybe in 80 territory -- but once The Rock flexes his way out of a cast with a BROKEN ARM, it gets as ridiculous and stupid as any of its predecessors. But it doesn't torpedo an entertaining flick.</quote>

  <quote>While there isn't anything in here that's spectacularly well-done, or even anything that we haven't seen before (and arguably done better), the flick is a throwback to the crime-dramas of old and in that respect I actually really enjoyed what I saw. Everyone's performances were really well-done (with particular emphasis on Sean Penn's performance, but, everybody loves a good bad guy). Sure there's loose ends, sure it's formulaic, sure the guy(s) get(s) the girl(s) in the end. But it's well-done.</quote>

Apparently this is deemed in general to be below that bar. I think that's silly. The worst thing that I can say about this movie in my own subjective example is that it's an exercise in style over substance. That's not even a bad thing necessarily! Don't engage the race-bait arguments, they're beneath you. Just go watch a visually cool-ass movie.</quote>

Not a complete disappointment, but a title that I will be the first to admit to hoping for more from. It's fine.</quote>

  <quote>Two quick thoughts. One, in terms of zombie antagonists, these are much closer to the menacing &quot;28 Days Later&quot; zombies, which I prefer, than the meandering herd zombies. Two, for being what looks like para-military, some of these soldiers are terrible shots. Also apparently zombies sleep and walk their zombie babies. So there's some give and take here. Takes on a very &quot;Last of Us&quot; feel midway through. Within the lexicon of zombie cinema, this is probably above-average. Check it out!</quote>

  <quote>Lots of laughs to be found in this one, though the emotional content (which yes, it does try to go for at times) leaves a little something to be desired.

I've seen some complaints about the &quot;consent&quot; running gag (which was only like two things, come to think of it), which is silly. If you go into it knowing what to expect (raunch, which they don't exactly keep a secret), you should have a good time.</quote>

  <quote>PSI was just about dead-on here, I thought it was funny enough and action-y enough to keep me interested. It works very well as a comic book movie, it introduces the primary characters enough to not feel rushed or undercooked. Always love to see Seth Rogan, and unlike a couple of other reviews on here, Seth Rogan is extremely deserving of leading roles, and they put a solid cast around him. Jay Chou's Kato character is probably the highlight of the flick, and it's another great show from Waltz.</quote>

  <quote>It's a beginner's guide to dystopianism that I understand has to be limited for its audience, but the world of the Hunger Games trilogy has real potential to be very, very gritty and harsh.

If you're willing to invest yourself in the idea of this world, it will likely work for you; if not, you may just think it's dumb and move on. Some pacing issues, but good characters.

It boasts a completely linear swerve-free plot that I'm not going to condemn it for; it's shut-your-brain-off movie-making fun that doesn't NEED a captivating story or twists and turns to be entertaining.

  <quote>For what it's worth, you should know that I am a GIGANTIC Marion Cotillard mark. She has been consistently phenomenal in everything I've seen her in. And to pair her with a talent the level of Joaquin Phoenix can make for magic. And Jeremy Renner is no slouch; he may actually be the flick's MVP. This isn't the greatest story you'll ever hear from this time and place, but that's not saying it's bad. It's good for what it is, and has really good performances of some flawed, intriguing characters.</quote>

  <summary>Set in the lower echelons of 1860s Paris, Therese Raquin, a sexually repressed beautiful young woman, is trapped into a loveless marriage to her sickly cousin, Camille, by her domineering aunt, Madame Raquin. Therese spends her days confined behind the counter of a small shop and her evenings watching Madame play dominoes with an eclectic group. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This is... odd, I guess? I can't call it BAD by any means. But cousins getting married, obscenely-overbearing matriarchs, and overt, sometimes-weirdly-placed sexuality kinda pulls this thing all over the place. Though it DOES set up a very good atmosphere, and the sexual tension in the early movie is also quite well-done. The under-the-table oral scene was a welcomed moment of comedy. It's melodramatic but that's what you're committing to. The second half really picks up. It's worth a good look.</quote>

  <quote>This definitely did its job well enough for me! I like the chemistry between the whole cast, but in particular between the two leads; de Niro is great at this sort of thing and Hathaway is just a great actress all-around. But I do have to concede that there were a lot of missed opportunities here to make a stronger statement, or to go in a more hard-line direction dramatically. It may leave you feeling that the dramatic elements were sort of lifeless and inconsequential. But go check it out!</quote>

  <quote>Standing out, if for nothing else, by being above-average within genres plagued by schlock, this leans into its atmosphere and insistent tone, making up for periodic moments of feeling like it may fly completely off its rails. Don't come to this for strength of performance or direction, but it can definitely be utilized to fill any horror void that you may be feeling. Between this and Upgrade, Leigh Whannell is carving out some worthwhile real estate, as this showcases much more good than bad.</quote>

  <summary>For 19-year-old Jay, fall should be about school, boys and weekends out at the lake. But after a seemingly innocent sexual encounter, she finds herself plagued by strange visions and the inescapable sense that someone, or something, is following her. Faced with this burden, Jay and her teenage friends must find a way to escape the horrors that seem to be only a few steps behind. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I would argue that this thing takes about a half-hour to get going. But once it does, it does a really good job of setting up its tense moments, and it has a good sense of atmosphere throughout. There's a lot of downtime in that first half-hour and the script &amp;amp; justifications aren't particularly good. But there is an undeniable air of &quot;shit is way scarier when it just walks towards you slowly than when it jumps out at you&quot;, and that's far more effective horror to me. This is worth checking out!</quote>

  <quote>Much of the opening is dominated by Kitsch's best Christian Bale growly-voice impression. In what starts feeling like an elongated, overly-dramatic episode of History's &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;, the flick moves along at a methodical but tolerable pace. The flick feels like a cross between 3:10 to Yuma and Avatar. I didn't like how they just fell ass-backwards into understanding each other's language, but that's minor. Very few gripes, but it all feels very... re-done. There's better, there's worse.</quote>

  <quote>It's a solid dramedy that survives Julia Roberts due to the inevitable &quot;I-want-to-get-behind-Tom-Hanks&quot; feeling. But, despite a divorce and getting fired, having no income to speak of for weeks on end (yet somehow affording to go back to school?), there's never this feeling of dread surrounding Larry; you never really feel like he's in trouble. The one scene of him being sad and the scene in the bank don't quite cut it. I guess I was hoping to see some dread. But it's a good movie nonetheless.</quote>

It doesn't totally torpedo the flick in my eyes, as I was pretty enchanted with Gerard's character, trying to understand his logic. Like most of these flicks, the main character's logic gets blurry and willfully ignorant as the flick goes on, which is unfortunate, and no, Gerard's character is not a great villain, and won't be remembered in the grand scheme of things. But you still find yourself sympathizing with him, even at the end.</quote>

Luckily, what's good tends to be great. Awesome music, atmosphere, and a great show from Tom Hardy. I enjoyed the subtle comedic elements. The climactic firefight is solid. See it!</quote>

Not as biting or socially relevant as its predecessor but still has things to say and a lot of laughs to be found. It's an unconventional, but pretty good, Batman movie. Check it out!</quote>

  <quote>Huh. I seem to be in something of the minority on this one but I actually felt that in most measurable ways, this was a step up from the first movie. I thought the visual effects were significantly better, and certain aspects of the story got a little darker, which is an element I felt was sorely lacking in the first. While &quot;darker Disney&quot; is something that may only appeal to a certain part of the audience, I was grateful, as I was for the expansion of the world of the feys. Worth the watch!</quote>

  <quote>Carrey does Kaufman to a tee.  Does that make for a great film?  No.  But it did its job.  I like Andy Kaufman as a character, very engrossing.</quote>

  <summary>In feudal China, a blacksmith who makes weapons for a small village is put in the position where he must defend himself and his fellow villagers. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Fun indulgent movie is fun and indulgent. It's no timeless tale of good versus evil, is a generic Chinese martial arts flick with a hip-hop swirl, spiced to the nines with both intense and comedic imagery. Thank God this isn't a movie that intends to take itself seriously as a strict and stern action movie. There's a story there, but it's more so something to... not ignore, but to only hold as secondary to the imagery and the fight scenes. It's shut-your-brain-off-and-mark-out-about-movies fun.</quote>

  <summary>An arthritic Nova Scotia woman works as a housekeeper while she hones her skills as an artist and eventually becomes a beloved figure in the community. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A more important story to somebody like me who's FROM Nova Scotia than it likely is to others. Hawkins is as-advertised: a virtuoso performance of the utmost believability. And as great as she is, luckily, Ethan Hawke damn near matches her. It takes you by surprise with humour, and has one scene in particular where it commands your emotions, sending you from laughter to stunned silence. It's a movie that lives and dies on performance, and is tremendously successful in my home province. See it!</quote>

I thought the cast did a good job with what they were given, I thought they were believable for the situation (if you can believe the situation, which is no problem for me because Sci-Fi), the monster design on the Grievers was good, and it sets up the second movie well (even with the apparent changes made from the source material, which don't matter to me - I haven't read the books). Cudos to Blake Cooper, in something of a breakout role. I say it's worth seeing.</quote>

  <quote>I think this creative team sat down and said &quot;Every cliche you can think of, let's get it in there&quot;. This is less a criticism... it's almost an accomplishment! They hit all the bases, no matter how obscure or quasi-racist. I dug this one, perhaps a bit more than the first, which I admittedly remember little about. At least this one went full &quot;Last of Us&quot; which is at least memorable. The new characters were welcomed additions, and this does its job of entertaining and setting up the third film.</quote>

  <quote>Epic casting and Star Wars jokes kind of save this for me. I'm not going to say it was bad, because it wasn't, and I can't bring myself to hate on Clooney or Obi-Wan, but there were too many &quot;in-between&quot; times (in between moments of action, comedy, etc.) that were just average. I felt frustrated by much of the flick, trying to figure it out and over-analyze. But, I give the flick some credit, because I believe that it is trying to make the audience think what McGregor's character mostly thinks.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoyed this and feel as though it does a serviceable job of telling its story, while at the same time, I admit that I'm not in love with it. There's nothing bad about it either, which adds to my frustration. This more closely associates with the Sci-Fi that I really like, and Nichols imposes his undeniable style upon a minimalist screenplay - minimalism which, for the record, is perfectly fine, as you don't need to be spoon-fed your messages. Not a miss, not a hit, but it's worth seeking out.</quote>

I'm something of a fatalist with Seth MacFarlane; he will go to ridiculous lengths to get laughs, and sometimes I love him for it, but sometimes it all just smacks of way too much effort. Some of the cameos were spectacular; I lost it upon seeing who played Abraham Lincoln, and the appearance of a certain gun-slinging exploitation-film icon just before the credits. In my opinion, it's worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>This movie was awfully romance-laden for being sold to me as &quot;not a romance movie&quot;. That doesn't make it bad; it just took me a little by surprise. I think this movie is a bit worse than I'm giving it credit for (or at least more bland and formulaic), but Elba and Winslet are just so goddamn good - in general, and specific to this movie. Again - it's formulaic, there are plot points unexplored or left hanging, and this is a rather incomplete film as a result. I just can't say I didn't like it.</quote>

  <summary>The Four Horsemen resurface and are forcibly recruited by a tech genius to pull off their most impossible heist yet. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Gets the friendly bounce to green-spectrum based on my thinking that it wasn't boring. I enjoyed myself. I can't say that I CARED about what was going on or that I felt the slightest dread for any of these characters, but, the tricks were fun and the cat-and-mouse game didn't wear me down, no matter how convoluted it got. Could have done without the phony romance. Ruffalo, Caine, Harrelson &amp;amp; Freeman are all treasures; the &quot;old vets&quot; leading the kids along. Hah, Harry Potter. Brilliant casting.</quote>

  <summary>What happens when Brooklyn comedian Donna Stern (Jenny Slate) gets dumped, fired and pregnant just in time for the worst/best Valentine's Day of her life.</summary>
  <quote>I was a bit worried when I found myself not laughing much at what I went into expecting to be a straight comedy, and, I wasn't immediately sold on Slate. Luckily as it moves on, both of these things changed: I was laughing more (though it became very clear that it wasn't just a comedy), and I bought into Slate a lot more. The whole &quot;I'm pregnant&quot; revelation was a bit rushed perhaps, but that was followed up really well and the whole flick was more than entertaining enough to keep me invested.</quote>

  <summary>Adrift in New York City, a recent college graduate's life is upended by his father's mistress.</summary>
  <quote>A complex but enjoyable story, that I think deserves to stick with you long after your viewing is done. Jeff Bridges falls nothing short of mastery of his craft. Amazon is really doing some great things with these films. I have to say, however, that this one falls short of some of their other productions for me, if for no other reason, than that it took a real dip in quality towards the end, before recovering quite admirably with its twist ending. This one is definitely worth checking out.</quote>

  <quote>There was a lot of smartly-executed, very cerebral material and aesthetic in Orphan. A good number of scenes in the flick were, no pun intended, pretty &quot;fucked&quot; up. But some just fell short. While the &quot;twist&quot; might grow on me, right now I don't feel like it was properly addressed or built upon. Nor was Ester's back-story. It was just kinda thrown out there. As were some character &quot;flaws&quot; (the husband's implied past infidelities). And the ending was too convenient. Still, good flick worth seeing.</quote>

  <quote>It's definitely worth taking a look at, if for no other reasons, the passionate performance of Bale, the &quot;better-than-the-character-deserved&quot; performance by Woody, and a short-but-excellent appearance by Dafoe. These guys seriously need more work. I like that it didn't draw out the final sequence to uncomfortable lengths, promptly giving us the satisfaction of the revenge, but in some other places... I won't say the movie half-asses some sub-plots, but, it doesn't do enough with some of them.</quote>

  <quote>We'll get it out there right away that it does what it's supposed to do, and that's scare people. I also actually consider it to be a BETTER movie than the second one (despite my ranking the second one an 80 and this a 70). This one's ranking falls down because of the ending. I'm finding it hard (and this is totally on a personal level) to piece the whole story together. Is it a demon, or a witches coven? What about the house fire alluded to in the first movie? A lot seems to be left unanswered.</quote>

  <quote>Dangerously close to being really good. The quirk is a little too heavy for me in dialogue &amp;amp; characterization; actually, I suspect that sometimes, this isn't a very good screenplay. Though I struggled with the believability of the premise, there are peaks of intensity and intrigue here that honestly deserved a bit better. This sits right on the precipice of being kind of revelatory; it just has a few too many moments of &quot;too precious&quot; to give it the full endorsement. But you should seek it out!</quote>

  <quote>This gave me basically what I wanted and was in no way fundamentally-flawed enough to knock it down from that. I'm a Javier Bardem mark so getting to see him ham it up to ridiculous levels was a big selling point for me. The editing leaves something to be desired as this is about 20-25 minutes longer than it needs to be and would arguably be more effective at 100 minutes vs. the 130 that it is. But for somebody like me who really dug the first movie and enjoys this universe, it totally works.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoyed this flick. Again I'm struggling with how much. I'm struggling to interpret the message of the movie; is it simply a &quot;cheaters never prosper except when they do&quot; flick? I liked that this is a movie with characters who are full of flaws but didn't come off as stereotypical or wooden. I burst out laughing (unintentionally) at the scene with the two cops screaming at a VERY CLEARLY DEAD BODY to put his hands in the air. The flick had an unbelievable score. An enigma, but in a good way.</quote>

  <quote>Aside from being quite racist, it's a really good Disney film.  You keep watching it, obviously, you see more and more of the racial undertones, but for its time and purpose, really good flick.  As for the people that bitch about the historical accuracy, you can't have under-10 year olds watching white people slaughter indians, that's not an appropriate movie.  Disney is shooting to tell a story of love with that as a backdrop, and for a kids movie, it works well enough.</quote>

  <quote>I'm giving this a generous bump to Serviceable. It's true that this movie loses a lot of the essence of the show. That was probably unavoidable. It's true that a lot of the fight scenes (okay, all of the fight scenes) aren't really all that fun. And it's true that these characters are more modernized and, therefore, a lot less quirky and likable. But what the movie accomplished for this 90's kid was that little nod and pat on the head of, &quot;We know you're in there, buddy&quot;. And that was worth it.</quote>

I didn't mind the Google Map thing, kinda iffy, but it sort of fits the theme so it's forgivable. Plot skips around a bit but, again, it's forgivable. Michael Shannon is really quite good, others besides JGL, not so much. The chase scenes are the bread and butter of the movie and on that level the flick is well-done. If you look at the story as secondary, it's good.</quote>

No one will be interested in it, so you can pocket the surplus. To this end, they produce a musical called Springtime for Hitler written by escaped Nazi Franz Liebken... (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>I like that the franchise takes concepts like propaganda, manipulation &amp;amp; economics, and uniquely smashes them together.

Don't get me wrong, I LIKE money as an enemy but, I guess I prefer a more singular villain. I do appreciate that the antagonists weren't just &quot;entitled educated college kids&quot; this time.

  <quote>About as good as the second if not a little better. I think you have to gobble these movies up like cotton candy to really enjoy them: forget that it's not real food and just enjoy the sugary goodness. And that's not a sleight against the franchise in the least. For the third time, the premise (and the swing on the formula) is interesting. Though I do think that they toned down the violence in this one. Maybe it was more about the message this go-round. This, like the others, is worth seeing.</quote>

  <summary>Seeking revenge for the death of his love, secret agent James Bond sets out to stop an environmentalist from taking control of a country's valuable resource.</summary>
  <quote>In most every way, a downgrade from Casino Royale - there seems to be a plateau in Bond's development and charm, it lacks one outstanding &quot;Bond Girl&quot; to target (indeed the role was split between Fields and Camille, which didn't entirely work for me), the antagonist(s) just didn't have the same pop as Le Chiffre, and while the &quot;action&quot; so to speak is mostly an upgrade, it might have been too much for a spy vs. an action hero. Needed to be longer and more subtle to achieve maximum &quot;Bond-ness&quot;.</quote>

  <quote>I have a weird relationship with this. I almost wanted it to suck when I first heard about it. This movie had, to quote... somebody, &quot;one fucking job&quot;, and that job was to be fun. Nothing more. It didn't have to reach any unanticipated heights, nor did it particularly have to wrestle against high expectations. It just had to be fun. &quot;Rampage&quot; is fun. It's dumb, and that's fine. It's not particularly well-written, and that's fine too. Rock does his Rock thing, there's some emotion. Worth seeing.</quote>

  <summary>A fictionalized account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe's life, in which the poet pursues a serial killer whose murders mirror those in the writer's stories. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Hm. Interested by the dislike for this movie. I thought Cusack's portrayal of Poe was exquisite and the reveal of the killer was done with care. I do believe that the method in which the killer &quot;gets away&quot; is rather... well, silly. He just... walks away. So yeah, Moriarty he ain't, but Moriarty he didn't have to be. Very very good performances I thought, though, from Cusack as Poe to Evans as Fields. It doesn't jerk you around with constant tiring twists that plague this genre. Worth seeing.</quote>

  <quote>This is a good movie in a lot of ways: the pacing, screenplay, and many of the performances. But in a way that sticks out like a sore thumb, it is very clearly an Eastwood film: the antithesis to whatever person/thing Eastwood is defending (in this case, Jewell, his antithesis being the media and the government) is presented as a pack of incredulous, almost bumbling fools. Yes, Jewell is the good guy, but his bad guy lacks menace and credibility due to its own Eastwoodian incompetence.</quote>

  <quote>Sicario 2 is missing several ingredients that made the first meal so appetizing. Emily Blunt (to take nothing away from Brolin and del Toro who are both great and believable), and the direction and artistic approach of Denis Villeneuve (Sollima did fine, but just fine), stand out the most as being missing. I don't think this had near the script of the first, nor made any attempt to make Mexico its own character, as the first did. I do think this aptly sets up a third, which I would be down for.</quote>

I'm such an Anna Kendrick mark, I'd watch her do anything, and she's enjoyable on the level of, a lot of this performance didn't feel like acting. She's just that awkward.

Feig might just be one of the more underrated writer-directors in the action-comedy genre.</quote>

Stewart's periodic overacting (something he seldom fell victim to during the series) hurt my experience. Data's trials with emotion were fine for the most part but perhaps under-explored.

  <quote>Having just finished binge-watching all of TNG, I've decided to tackle the movies. Here's something I never appreciated fully in the past: mothafuckin Tom Hardy! I would say that this is arguably Patrick Stewart's best performance in the four TNG films. Part of that could well be from having a foil the calibre of Hardy, even in 2002. The killing off of Data is I'm sure a sore point for some Trekkies even today. I would have preferred a different send-off for the TNG crew. It is what it is: fine.</quote>

It's definitely a movie worth seeing; doesn't exactly write the book or re-define the coming-of-age flick, but has interesting characters with complicated inter-relationships, and the camp itself plays an integral role, almost becoming a character in and of itself. Plus is has awesome narration from Jon Cusack. Sweet nicknames, too.</quote>

  <quote>One of the tougher movies I'll review this year, because of the place ST holds in my heart. Of note, Chandrasekhar's direction hasn't changed in 15+ years. Like other sequels, this doesn't HAVE to be the original to be good; this is good, but, I'd be lying if I said I thought it was anything more. The Can-Am humor works for me, and it really was great to see these characters again. But I'm left fighting that ugly &quot;we waited 16 years for this?&quot; feeling. Not disappointed, but aspired for greater.</quote>

  <quote>Sometimes you watch a movie and it really gets over how much fun the people making it are having, just making a fun movie. That's how I feel about Tag. It's light and pretty fun. Helms and Buress in particular are really funny. While it does take things a step or two &quot;too far&quot; in terms of what I would consider good taste, I wasn't personally offended by anything I saw. Kinda stuck out that this was Tomsic's first feature in four years; his direction left a bit to be desired. Worth seeing though!</quote>

I'm no fan of Mr. Bay, and there are totally some moments where you shake &amp;amp; scratch your head, or out-and-out cringe. They really play up the &quot;teenage&quot; aspect, be prepared for that, and I didn't REALLY like Donatello's personality. I won't say that I loved all the creative choices made. That being said, this was such undeniable fun. It's sweet, sweet candy, but it's organic so it's still KINDA good for you. Don't believe the negative hype.</quote>

If you're gonna use 3D, do it in such a way that makes people, after seeing the movie, either A) want to see it again; B) tell their friends to see it in 3D; or C) both. &quot;Thor&quot; does none of these. Luckily it's worth seeing because of what actually happens IN the movie (which is the main thing of course). Just don't shell out your extra $$$ to see it in 3D. Has some humor and alright action.

Beckinsale didn't exactly re-define the villain or anything, but was solid and sexy and that's really all we needed. I may have qualms with the ending (although I appreciate open-ended finales), but it's also something of an homage to the first film. Worth seeing!</quote>

  <quote>I love the material, and at the same time hate how far Clatts has departed from the cinematography that built the series. Flick suffered from the same formula of season 7; it focused too much on Bubbles rather than him being the side-kick character, where he's best. With no single scheme throughout, the movie feels too chaotic. There were two ways to properly end the tale: they go to jail forever or they make it big; neither happens, which is very disappointing to the series' hardcore fanbase.</quote>

  <quote>Dammit Loomis, why'd you have to play the most awkwardly-hilarious, random race card in cinema history? Chiwetel Ejiofor, despite being given loads of credit for his most recognizable role in &quot;12 Years A Slave&quot;, may yet be underrated. Here he pulls off close to a master performance, as a lonely, paranoid man at the end of the world. I would say it's his performance specifically that made this enjoyable for me. Chris Pine and Margot Robbie would make gorgeous babies, though. Check this one out!</quote>

  <quote>A throwback sit-com which hits the funny without asking its audience to think... well, at all. Felt like Danny McBride wrote it even though he didn't, same kind of comedy, but comes off better than his last effort (&quot;Your Highness&quot;). McBride is starting to suffer from Will Ferrell syndrome (playing the same character each and every time out). I wonder how many people caught the &quot;Social Network&quot; reference early on, I laughed at that a lot. It did its job, but I won't seek out seeing it ever again.</quote>

  <quote>Athenians AREN'T as much fun as Spartans. &quot;300&quot; it ain't. To clarify, 300 is a bad movie that stands as perhaps my top all-time guilty pleasure. This is a bad movie a second time, with a director who, despite his best efforts to look like Zack Snyder, ISN'T Zack Snyder and shouldn't have tried to be. Eva Green and her bare chest is a high point (though that sex scene was self-aware silliness). The persistent narration can get annoying. Don't see it in 3D. I love the universe too much to hate it.</quote>

  <quote>This is a movie that is sure to engender different reactions from different demographics. It's not BAD but I don't think I can characterize it as good, either. At least, good in the conventional sense of Sci-Fi. Which is maybe an unfair metric. This is more of a Drama with a dystopian Sci-Fi glaze. Written &quot;by feminists, for feminists&quot;, which is fine, and it expresses a number of interesting ideas in visually-interesting ways. Performances just aren't there for me. Ditto for the wonky dialogue.</quote>

  <quote>I'll say this -- it is definitely the best of these three movies, hopping over a relatively-low-hanging bar. At the end of the day, I really could not get into these movies on a consistent enough basis to really recommend them. Woodley gives her best performance but still feels useless to the plot at times. I kept waiting for random romances to start getting shoe-horned in; luckily it didn't happen. Bottom line, these movies SHOULD be better, and aren't. But you've come this far. Finish it up.</quote>

  <summary>Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other &quot;female&quot; interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war. (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>I get the feeling that fans of the book - a co-worker of mine is a MASSIVE fan - may find this movie lacking in how quickly it moves from plot point to plot point.

Amanda Seyfried is really good; it's probably the best performance of hers I've ever seen. I'm not in love with it, though there's content of value here.</quote>

  <quote>This movie had a shit-ton of hype behind it, which I think makes me instinctively skeptical. However. There were some definite solid laughs (the &quot;Fight Club&quot; line made me lose it) and something of a story to it. 90% of the comedy came from Melissa McCarthy, but, she is so damn funny that it really makes up for something of an un-funny cast outside of her, Wiig, and O'Dowd. But it's a good female buddy comedy - it does the things that, if Sex &amp;amp; The City did them, it wouldn't be such a trainwreck.</quote>

  <quote>Initially I dug the late 80's/early 90's feel to this movie: quick-hit scenes that don't dump too much story on you, just background info and character intros. Story takes about 20 minutes to start unfolding, and when it does it seems like a fairly cut-and-dry detective story that could serve as an okay way to spend a few minutes. There's good and bad. The political stuff doesn't bog me down, and when the real story is finally swung on us it definitely improves. It's convention done decently.</quote>

  <quote>The end of this movie was soul-crushing. I feel bad for saying that, but it's true. I was actually entertained! Enjoying myself! Stuff was interesting! Ramirez is really good and doesn't just play the cut-and-dry &quot;normal&quot; priest! It was going really well, like 80/100 territory. And then that ending. I'm not talking about the exorcism, that was fine. I'm talking about the cop-out &quot;Miami Vice&quot; ending, where everything just falls into place in the laziest ways possible. Could have been a contender.</quote>

  <quote>For me this is a movie of tremendous premise that slips in more than one spot in its execution. The main trio are fine in most cases, though I think their characters are rather hollow with the exception of Jane Levy. There are those moments, however, where typical thriller and horror logic (or lack thereof) comes into play. Stephen Lang is a boss, though. I feel like the ending is somewhat wasted, though. It's going for something that is kind of pointless to go for. But it could be WAY worse.</quote>

  <quote>I like Brit flicks. They always seem to have this aesthetic of dread that American movies can rarely match. And British movies have the market cornered on real, raw emotion. But onto the important stuff: the girls are BEAUTIFUL. Not just sex appeal it's real *beauty*. And it's always fun to see truly beautiful girls get down. Full frontal nudity and good simulated sex scenes are included in the price of admission. Not to mention some excellent and the most innovative kill scenes I've ever seen.</quote>

  <quote>I appreciate the throwback nature of it, the intro looked like something out of the 70s which I dug. But it seemed to me like DMTH was a second-tier Grudge, with the blatant A/V scares one would expect from such a flick. I'm sorry, but dancing demons and CGI demon-goats don't entertain me. That whole scene was just a little too &quot;Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video&quot; for me. I was a fan for about a half-hour - the sequence in the car was fucking harsh and I dug it. After that... just fell apart.</quote>

  <quote>There's good and bad to be found in this flick, which takes monstrous stylistic turns in an attempt to appear gritty and real... which sadly renders some portions wholly unrealistic. The good includes many of the performances; while Denzel is Denzel, can John Goodman get some love? Dude is phenomenal! The flight sequence and Kelly Reilly are both great. Sadly, the bad is as evident as Whip's alcoholism, and the movie somewhat devolves to preachy, religious anti-alcohol dogma. Far from brilliant.</quote>

It's an intentionally-unrealistic buddy-heist romp in the spirit of &quot;The Little Old Lady Who Broke All The Rules&quot;, and that's all it's trying to be; in that, it succeeds on the strengths and undeniable chemistry of Freeman, Caine, and Arkin. Is it particularly incredible at any one thing, or even as the sum of its parts? Not really. But it's very watchable, and you could do worse this weekend.</quote>

Solid direction. But hey -- you can't please everybody.</quote>

  <quote>Okay, so it's Tom Cruise. And it's Tom Cruise playing an action hero. So that's all well and good. And the humor in his character went over well with me, it had a decent variance of subtle comedy and fairly standard action which isn't &quot;sub-par&quot;, just kind of forgettable. I'm having a hard time writing this review, as the memorability factor of this movie MIGHT be in the negative. But still, as a one-off watch, it gets a pass on the high side of average, and is worth the rental when it comes out.</quote>

  <quote>Knight of Cups is, without question, ambitious and intriguingly-presented. Yet I fear that ambition alone, even when intriguing, does not a good movie make. Ambition in art can often give way to pretense, and here Malick crosses that line on more than one occasion. I've no qualms with the concept and definitely appreciate the experimentation, as well as the intense sensory gravitas that Malick accomplishes. I can't call this bad, but I can't call it good, either. It's kind of its own thing.</quote>

Beyonce as Nala. That's about it. Distracting voice acting and unflattering CGI (if you're going for, y'know, emotion) underscore the absolute lack of need for this remake. I didn't hate it.

  <quote>I rather enjoyed this as an action-comedy.

Most people seemed to think that the movie was relatively bland, which I don't really agree with, at no point in the movie did I feel bored. Were the premises flimsy? Sure they were. Was it silly at times? Sure it was. But it was still fun. It was still engaging. And I was entertained.</quote>

  <quote>&quot;Morgan&quot; builds its universe rather quickly, managing to hold interest despite precious little backstory and context. It does what most good Sci-Fi thrillers do, which is to present an investment-worthy hook (&quot;What's going to happen to Morgan?&quot;). Also, Paul Giamatti is life. It does definitely cross the line into pretty well straight-up action movie for awhile, and not to the story's benefit, I think ultimately failing where other similar movies have succeeded. Decent little twist at the end.</quote>

  <quote>I struggled with the idea of giving a Peter Jackson (ish) movie a mediocre score. But honestly, despite tepid expectations, I just didn't enjoy the movie enough to recommend that others should watch it. Visually stunning, and may even demand a 3D viewing if you're so inclined. But it took me altogether too long to get on board with the kinda-dystopic-but-not-really premise, and the material that I did enjoy, was too little and far between. Motivationally frustrating.

  <quote>This is pretty predictably enjoyable, especially for a young audience. The running gags and canine puns get a little thick eventually, but there's also some really funny moments to be found, and the animation is really solid. The movie's strongest segments are, of course, the time-travel segments, as a lot of the &quot;real-world, Sherman-is-growing-up&quot; stuff is nothing you haven't seen before (aside from the montage sequence, which was really good). And Robespierre getting tazed... still funny brah.</quote>

As a whole, this is a movie of just enough. There's just enough action to be exciting, just enough emotional content to be investing. The direction does just enough to keep interest in what you're seeing; the script, just enough to keep interest in what you're hearing. It is neither a great Stallone, nor a great Rambo.

Honestly though, this was *fine*. Inoffensive and very proud of being &quot;different&quot; from the classic story. A vehicle for a sequel that, as RealMacgyver points out, likely doesn't get made. Coated from top to bottom in wannabe grit, but I wasn't bored, and if that's the best I can say, that's at least something.</quote>

  <summary>In 2028 Detroit, when Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop - is critically injured in the line of duty, the multinational conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>We can't accurately make a decision on this movie if we try to hold it up to the original. This is a re-imagining of RoboCop with only sparse elements brought over. This isn't a dystopic criminal cesspool, for instance, it's just Detroit, and the motivations for building RoboCop are completely different. Are they better or worse? Subjective. I like that there are multiple unanswered questions to lead to a sequel. Good for what it is: flash, arguably less substance, but entertaining nonetheless.</quote>

  <quote>Loses its shine in comparison to the others, doesn't have an Apollo- or Drago- calibre character to fuel the conflict, but is still a really genuine and human film. For those who say that this movie was the biggest reason for &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, you have very little comprehension of the idea of FALLING IN LOVE WITH A CHARACTER. Sly loves Rocky because he IS Rocky at the most fundamental levels. &quot;Balboa&quot; is as much about Rocky letting go of boxing and the past as it is about Sly letting go of Rocky.</quote>

  <quote>I think, had they not sort of crapped out on the Ghostface reveal and what happened from that point on, this would be a bit farther up the line. As it stands right now though, it doesn't quite hit the &quot;Serviceable&quot; mark. The meta-cognitive nature of the Scream franchise is so very lovely, don't get me wrong, and always makes for an entertaining watch - I was most definitely entertained but it wasn't to the next level. Like most others here, I give big props to Hayden Panettiere and Emma Roberts.</quote>

  <quote>I laughed, and quite frankly that was really all that I needed from this movie. I had no delusions going into this that it was going to be some cinematic masterpiece. There are no stakes, nothing in the narrative particularly matters, and the performances are only adequate, but this isn't really a movie that needs high quality in those terms. It just needs to be funny. For the most part, this is funny, and Susanna Fogel, notable for not much up to now, succeeds here as both writer and director.</quote>

  <quote>I will credit this movie for a few things: not being as jingoistic as &quot;Flight&quot;, and I think giving cudos and props (if a little heavy-handedly) where they deserve to be given above and beyond the pilot(s). And I have to admit (like everyone else who watches this) to not knowing enough about the &quot;true goings-on&quot; to comment on whether they were portrayed melodramatically or not. And Hanks is his usual brilliant self. But this did feel over-dramatic and &quot;Hollywoodized&quot;. It's not irredeemable.</quote>

I'm very forgiving to Sci-Fi as I've said many times before, but even if I wasn't, it was still a decent film. It looked very nice, but let's face it guys and gals, Jaden Smith would not have an acting career if Will Smith wasn't his father. He's a weak-ass lead here though Will Smith was alright. Kinda predictable, decent monster design, some stupidity... ultimately, not bad, but forgettable.</quote>

  <quote>It's a drop for me from Furious 7 which is the first of these that I can say I had fun with. But if the plan is to infuse these movies with like 10% more story each time, I'm down, because it's to their benefit. Charlize was a boss and a good villain. I can't tell you anything else you probably don't already know. It's dumber than 7, the action isn't as good as 7, there's not much script to speak of, it subscribes to all the worst elements of its predecessors, but is more entertaining than some.</quote>

  <quote>Like my review for &quot;Orphan&quot;: a lot of well-executed material in the first half, but it's now painfully obvious that Hollywood can no longer negotiate an ending. This movie does, however, make a liar out of my review for &quot;Click&quot;, where I state that Sandler is not a dramatic actor. He's not a GREAT one, but he actually had me sucked into his character. The &quot;Dante/Randal&quot; dynamic between Sandler/Rogan pales in comparison to Dante and Randal, but is still there and I appreciate it. Funny in spurts.</quote>

  <quote>This was fine but unspectacular. Far from the worst thing on film this year -- and in a world where Replicas exists, not even the worst movie about cloning to come out this year -- but very much a throwback to a time when action movies just needed to have the good guy win at the end. Ang Lee is a great director but doesn't exactly haul this thing up Quality Mountain. But I'm also a Mary Elizabeth Winstead mark, so any time she's on screen, I am there for it. cagedwisdom nails it in his review.</quote>

  <quote>This is a movie that I'm glad exists. I'm glad it spits in the face of the unreasonable hatred from adult virgins moaning about ruined childhoods, by actually being fun in spots, and never becoming BAD. There is totally an audience for this movie that is going to have a lot of fun with it, and if it translates into even a small percentage of this film's audience seeking out the original, I can't hate that. But it's a lot of so-called &quot;relevant&quot; comedy, which sometimes hits and sometimes misses.</quote>

  <quote>There's a lot of anger in the early movie that either doesn't make sense, or isn't explained well. Maybe this is how things really were, but from a &quot;movie&quot; perspective, it's a case of &quot;there for the sake of being there&quot; things with not a lot of explanation, when it doesn't take much effort to explain them. The whole flick reeks of perspective bias, which I guess is to be expected. Love me some JEJ &amp;amp; Rosario Dawson. Hudgens is hit-and-miss. Inoffensive, has its moments, but not the greatest.</quote>

  <quote>Let's be clear about what this movie is: it's made and marketed for a specific audience, but does its job in presenting a pretty watchable story for a wider audience despite being over two hours long. It isn't uproariously funny for the most part -- though as most have pointed out, Tiffany Haddish is the all-star -- nor is the drama particularly spellbinding. What it does do is mix the two well, with relatively few moments of inconsequential feelings. I can safely call this a pleasant surprise.</quote>

I like Maguire's Caraway; Leo's Gatsby however is hit-and-miss, as it's a victim of Baz's atrocious writing and direction. When the film takes a breath in the second half, the quality improves.

It's still kinda jump-scare dependent (though the jumps were better this go-round!), but it does a much better job of being creepy versus just jumpy, and it has a better story. Creepy woods trumps creepy house any day.</quote>

This feels good, feels the way it probably should feel, and I'll never deride anything artistic for being different. But I've got to be honest, this just didn't work for me. It's very insistent on its tone, which is good, but then proceeds to shit itself with unrealistic, over the top reactions. I'm not a cynical viewer, I like much more often than dislike.

Where the flick falls to Earth is in its blatant predictability and the mindless evolution of the two romances. Jude Law is sexy, yes, but anybody could call that, and... I dunno, there was nothing all that special about it. When I rely on Jack Black to &quot;save&quot; a romantic comedy, something is wrong.</quote>

But the movie isn't without its problems - the male lead(s) are completely interchangeable, the romances feel forced (can be explained away as heat-of-the-moment, but still) and the dialogue is unbalanced.</quote>

  <summary>A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I'll be honest: I tried my hardest to go in with as few expectations as possible. Tough in this day and age. But with an open mind, absolutely. I liked the chemistry between Clarke and Claflin for the most part, and the first half of this movie I actually can say that I quite enjoyed. For me however the second half becomes clunky, self-important, and cliche-ridden. Is it emotional? Sure. Is it predictable? I believe so. And I'm more comfortable calling this movie &quot;not bad&quot;, rather than &quot;good&quot;.</quote>

  <summary>Jason Statham stars as an experienced hit man who decides he's ready to retire his weapons once and for all -- after he finishes training eager young apprentice Steve McKenna (Ben Foster) in the ways of the professional kill. But the assassin's bosses are not pleased when they discover their man is giving away his trade secrets. Simon West directs and Donald Sutherland co-stars in this action-packed remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson thriller.</summary>
  <quote>I enjoy seeing Statham play a conflicted character. Clearly he's rolling along, not giving a fuck, until he has to kill his mentor, at which point he takes a predictable turn and questions what he does. It's fairly by the numbers. The SUV scene with the bus was pretty badass. I, among others, despised the ending, and just when Hollywood was fumbling along fairly well with their endings after the debacle that was 2009. Needs to be longer and wrap up more loose ends; there were plenty to be found.</quote>

  <quote>Yeah my PSI was pretty darn accurate here. This is the very definition of a popcorn flick. Knew that going in, feel that expectation was fulfilled without being expanded upon. I had a fine time. There's enough humour sprinkled throughout that even though it's almost two hours, it didn't strike me as overlong. The 3D was, surprisingly, not completely useless, like 3D normally is. And at least Ruby Rose didn't die. Also, I remember Page Kennedy from Vine. The good old days. Yeah this is fine.</quote>

  <quote>A passable follow-up to what I thought was a very underrated first movie. The cast did what they had to do, didn't shine, but it was kind of cool to see the guy who played &quot;Cheddar Bob&quot; in 8 Mile make an appearance. The rape scene was quite tame compared to what we're becoming more and more used to in today's cinema, and like always, there had to be some token tits. I wasn't a fan of the kills; whoever did the SFX for this should be fired. Looked mid-90's; we're in 2010 guys, step your game up.</quote>

  <quote>It's pretty Hollywood, which is to be expected I guess. Love the cast, but a couple of them just played themselves; Clooney = Clooney, Murray = Murray, and in a movie that purports itself to be biographical, it seems to me that it would have been prudent to check the ego at the door and play the role, not play oneself. Be actors, not movie stars. I certainly didn't dislike it, it had its entertaining moments, but I do feel as though there was something more to be had here. Read the book instead.</quote>

  <quote>It's pretty shut-your-brain-off fun. It borders on less-flashy DBZ, Crouching Tiger-inspired fight scenes at times, but that's not all bad. It probably could have done without the absolute saturation of its trailer, which literally played before EVERY movie leading up to its release. It was entertainment, definite eye candy for the 16-30 male demo, and it does its job -- gratuitous ninja action, loose and linear plot, and even more gratuitous ninja action. Plus the dude's name is Rain. Ch'yea.</quote>

  <quote>Being a nervous flyer myself, this one wasn't a particularly-hotly-anticipated watch for me, but I like Liam Neeson a lot and I love Julianne Moore, and I'm always up for a good suspense/thriller/mystery. On that level the movie worked pretty well -- a solid mystery that I didn't get to the end of too quickly, and the performances were adequate (Neeson has his wonky moments as always; that's part of his charm). Unfortunately, the climax does not do justice to the build. Still worth watching.</quote>

  <quote>There's some sexist shit going down here and it's really a bummer because this should have been so much better. I can explain a lot of the bad or questionable of this movie away and it becomes somewhat enjoyable, but I can only do that by coming at it from the perspective of Chris Pratt's character being a scumbag that isn't supposed to be a sympathetic character. But then the movie kind of tries to make him one, sorta. Stockholm Syndrome in space. Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe it.</quote>

An ensemble which was mostly-boring (a few exceptions, like Trejo) accented by a totally-unnecessary showing by Laurence Fishburne. Now I love the 'burne, but really, he was not necessary at all. I was fairly happy with the soundtrack and the overall ambiance and mood of the flick, it did get over as quite dreary and hopeless. But it was by no means redeeming. Not even close.</quote>

Sadly I felt the movie gives in to ridiculousness, and many scenes with the shark itself devolve from intimidating tension, to just silliness. But Steven Seagull gives a powerhouse performance.</quote>

  <quote>While the depth of this flick barely nips at your ankles, I thought it worked for what it was. It takes a certain (minor!) view on the direction of technology and explores its surface, but I find myself mostly a fatalist with this flick - I knew what was going to happen, basically from the outset, and I'd resigned myself to it. The twist was quite cool, you could probably see it coming but it eluded me and so it popped for that, I was engrossed in Brucey's mystique, but that can only go so far.</quote>

  <summary>Still single and increasingly attuned to the cacophony of her biological clock, 40-something Kassie (Jennifer Aniston) decides that if she can't find a mate she'll still pursue motherhood with the help of a sperm sample that's not quite as anonymous as she thinks. As the baby grows up, Kassie's best friend, Wally (Jason Bateman), agonizes over whether to reveal that he secretly replaced the donor sample with his own DNA.</summary>
  <quote>I mean, it is what it is. It's a rom-com and a sitcom rolled into one, and it's not as if I got nothing out of it. I laughed, heartily in places, I thought the performances were adequate to good, Thomas Robinson (the kid) was VERY funny, almost all of his lines were golden. And Jeff Goldblum lays down yet another very solid comedic performance. It's not at all my kind of movie - truthfully, I wouldn't have seen it had my friend not badly wanted to - but I can't say I walked away empty-handed.</quote>

The dynamic between Kudrow and Robinson offers some laughter. Kendrick is her usual awesome self. Ultimately, it's a movie of scattered moments resulting in an incomplete whole, but in saying that, there are things here to like. You could do worse.</quote>

I will preface this by saying, I like loud, but T:S is obnoxiously loud; loud to the point that it detracts from the film itself. Ahhnold's CGI-ness was enough to make me mark out a little, was probably the apex of the flick from an excitement standpoint, just seeing him. It bothered me that, by the end, nothing had changed.

  <quote>It's a cool idea to take the series somewhat away from vampires versus lycans and turn it instead towards the battle of both against humanity once they are discovered. At least on the surface (DUN DUN DUN!). I was really digging it, it gives you the action you want, it has a storyline you can work with even if you're not a big connoisseur of the series, the CGI is forgivably crummy in places but it has characters that I feel are worthy of  empathy. A bit quick &amp;amp; a bit short but worth your time.</quote>

  <quote>The early part of the film suffers in two ways: the screenplay feels weak, and the narrative feels too rushed; nothing is given any time to breathe, especially the romance. Once it moved to Botswana, finally there is some patience shown in the storytelling. Oyelowo's impassioned performance propels the story while Rosamund Pike is mostly just kinda there. Most white people are stereotypical scumbags, but this is probably both intentional and accurate. Won't blow you away but it's an okay watch.</quote>

Sadly I had the twist ruined for me via social media (though admittedly, even if it hadn't been, I may have gotten to it before the movie does while watching; plenty of signs without being out-and-out predictable). It doesn't strum that metacognitive-horror-comedy tune like &quot;Cabin in the Woods&quot; does, but, it was sufficiently funny and scary in parts to pass the time. Not great, not awful.</quote>

It's a spectacle piece, and Emmerich should be commended for the grand scale he achieved. And for casting Woody in a borderline-perfect role. It had decent pacing, and I think the scenes in the Antonov aircraft were some of the film's best non-disaster-scenario scenes. But ultimately, it's a forgettable movie.</quote>

Sure (mostly) everything wraps up in a neat little package at the end but hey, that doesn't automatically translate to &quot;bad&quot;. It's a three-act fairy tale people!

  <quote>This is not a bad movie. My rating may not reflect that, but trust me when I say this is not a bad movie. I think this is a movie that is lost in time and place. I felt that this offered me too little in terms of material, things, characters, and situations in which I could invest. Maybe that's due to the age of the source material, I don't know. I can appreciate the historical context, and can appreciate that this movie is well made. Unfortunately, it did not connect with me personally.</quote>

  <quote>It's a sizable improvement from the last flick, given that this flick had a pretty good villain that created a sense of dread and doubt, the performances and emotional content &amp;amp; evocations improved (even though at times, Walker &amp;amp; Diesel have the emotional range of tree stumps), and the action felt worthwhile (except for the obnoxiously-long runway scene, which... how fucking long can a runway be?). But there was some token bullshit, and come on... it's a two-hour souped-up car commercial.</quote>

  <quote>Inoffensive is the perfect word for this movie. It's not great, by any stretch, though I do think it's directed well, and the cast is... fine, I guess? It's also not bad by any stretch. It's just... I dunno, it leaves you with nothing after the fact. You feel for the characters in the moment but immediately after the movie you forget about 98% of them. This is not a movie that is likely to make any kind of indent on you at all. It's just there, and it's fine for the time it takes to watch it.</quote>

  <summary>An edgy Shakespeare adaptation like no other, this animated musical transports the classic tale of forbidden romance between two star-crossed lovers from warring families to the unlikely yet hysterical world of garden gnomes.</summary>
  <quote>I mean, you can only take a modern re-telling of Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet from the perspective of gnomes so seriously, and suspend your disbelief to such a degree before you just can't be bothered anymore. It's not a bad movie by any means, it's a cute kids/family movie and on that level it does what it sets out to do. I do certainly recommend seeing it if you have kids or are in the mood for something cute. Maybe being forced to watch it over and over at work ruined it for me. You can probably skip it.</quote>

  <quote>Hollywood has yet to learn that the sociopathic mean girls trope isn't funny or interesting anymore. Or at least this writer/director duo hasn't. This wasn't as bad as I expected it to be but it's far from any kind of accomplishment. We've already had a &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; style movie with horrible teen girls learning lessons this year in &quot;Before I Fall&quot;, and while this may be marginally better, its attempts at cheap self-awareness and shoehorned comedy don't do it any favors. Scares are infrequent.</quote>

And then, there's the implied rape scene. Yeah. It's a pretty bad movie, but it's intriguing. The ending sucks, though.</quote>

  <quote>In addition to ridiculously-high standards for comic book movies, we also have ridiculously-high standards for kids movies in 2015. And for me, as an adult, this didn't get it done quite enough. Don't get me wrong, this is nowhere near a bad movie, and the kids will eat it up. The animation is spectacular and I think, had this movie come out pre-Wall-E, it would be pretty well-thought-of. The final ten minutes are great but you gotta GET there first, and too little worthwhile happens beforehand.</quote>

It wants to be a dramedy, but the silly narrator didn't work for me, nor the emo juxtaposition between humanity &amp;amp; Carl Sagan. Overall it's too insincere to pass on a worthwhile message, despite there being a worthwhile message TO pass on. More kids, less adults.</quote>

  <quote>Okay so, we sacrifice the suburban white neighborhood for a latino one, with a whole new cast of characters. While I really wasn't a fan of PA4, I have to say that this one was a slight improvement. There's still plenty of shitty teenage dialogue to be found, but the scares still worked, the camera gimmick was at least mostly fresher than it has been the last two movies, and you actually become sympathetic to the characters instead of not caring. Too many false finishes. See it if you're a fan.</quote>

This is not what I would classify as a &quot;good&quot; movie, but it is one that's worth taking a look at, if for nothing else, the 90's feel coupled with the badass vision of the future of the Predator character.

You can tell, once the stylistic tone of the film takes a sharp turn, that they were shooting for self-indulgence and that's it. Law and Whitaker did their jobs well enough, not like they had to be Brando but they did enough and I bought into their dynamic. Not every movie needs to be realistic.</quote>

That was oddly refreshing; about the only thing in this movie that was so.</quote>

My advice to you if you hated the character development, inter-relationships, writing, etc. is to stop watching Transformers movies for those things. There's too little fighting &amp;amp; Dinobots, too much human element, weak storytelling, average performances, everything you read is true. But rumors of this being the worst movie of the year are greatly exaggerated.</quote>

  <summary>Frank Martin is the most highly-skilled transporter money can buy. The stakes are greater and technology better, but the same three simple rules apply: never change the deal, no names and never open the package. When Frank is hired by cunning femme fatale Anna and her three stunning sidekicks, he quickly discovers he's been played. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This is... not UN-entertaining, but, not exactly anything special, either. The change from Jason Statham to &quot;younger Jason Statham&quot; is not to the franchise's benefit. Points for some relatively-innovative fight scenes and a plot that is at least somewhat interesting, even if hackneyed and cobbled-together. I also dig the fact that every time the antagonist shows up, BOOM, there's booty. This is not disappointing if you have no expectations; if you're really psyched for this... prepare yourself.</quote>

  <quote>Am I an idiot for not hating this? I fear I might be because really, I didn't hate this. Don't be deluded, this isn't a GOOD movie. By objective narrative standards it's probably pretty dumb. And there's stuff that doesn't add up. And it's kinda just the same old song-and-dance from previous movies. At the very least it opened with a retelling of the key points from the series up to this point; excellent for the casual viewer like me. I just shut my brain off and it worked well enough for me.</quote>

  <summary>It's a nail-biting race against time as an unmanned train carrying a load of lethal chemicals speeds out of control, and a conductor and engineer do everything in their power to keep it from derailing and killing tens of thousands of people. Denzel Washington leads the cast in Tony Scott's tough-minded thriller, in which a terrible circumstance forces a couple of ordinary men to become extraordinary heroes.</summary>
  <quote>&quot;It's all about precision&quot;. I'll say, &quot;See it if you're looking for a loud action movie with some drama&quot;. In some places, the drama felt tacked on, unnecessary plot points and the like. And it was obnoxiously loud, like &quot;Terminator:Salvation&quot; loud. Maybe I'm just getting old, but when a movie is THAT loud it takes away from my enjoyment. Like I get it, it's a big train that's moving really fast, but jeez, that's just poor sound editing.

  <quote>For a sequel to a movie that I somewhat enjoyed despite probably giving it too much credit, this one sets up a rather nice atmosphere amidst WWII England. It's still trope-heavy -- the abandoned-for-years haunted house with the ghost that only the mute child usually sees, with mostly-one-note characters outside of the protagonist heroine. You've seen all this before. But I do LOVE the way this looks. Is it scary? Sort of. It's more atmospheric than scary; in that, it succeeds. It's worth a look!</quote>

  <quote>Hearing a lot of &quot;what did you expect?&quot; from reviews. I expect that when you sink millions of dollars into a film venture, there's a decent return. Granted this flick only cost 12 million to make, which is a modest budget. No better than B-level, very pro-military quasi-fiction, but at the same time no worse I guess. At times the editing looks very 80's, cookie-cutter story, archetypal characters, not-bad action. The FPS action didn't work for me; then again, I'm not CoD brony. It's just there.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoy the found footage style. Aside from a bit of obvious bad Hollywooding, I think that aspect of the movie really succeeds, and it does a lot of little things right. It gets the atmosphere and cinematography spot-on, it lays out the characters without delving too much into any one individual (I usually prefer more development, but here it really works), it had suspense and scares... I dunno, I'm not sure where the hate comes from. I enjoyed myself. Bear in mind, I'm forgiving to this genre.</quote>

There's just one problem, though: He's already dating Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), the most revered teacher on campus. And Ms. Squirrel is not at all eager to hand over her beau, who is slated to inherit his family's fortune.</summary>
  <quote>Don't get me wrong, there were laughs. And &quot;good enough&quot; performances. But the characters were wooden, and never really changed course from their original singular overwhelming character trait (except Diaz towards the end, but this was superficial at best). Jason Segel was hands-down my favorite character. I just can't help but feel like this movie pales in comparison to others this year within the comedy genre, and as such, sorry, not good enough for me. See it only if you only watch comedies.</quote>

I can definitely appreciate both the 70's feel and the indirect references to 70's movies/shows thrown in there (a bit before my time but still appreciated).

  <quote>Dominic Monaghan's offbeat and increasingly-unhinged performance is probably the primary highlight of what is somewhere between an underwhelming and passable Sci-Fi thriller.

Visuals were fine, otherwise this is little more than a footnote, though not horrible.</quote>

  <quote>God I cannot handle Luke Wilson. He just comes off so fake to me. And I don't think the dude can act. His inner narratives were his highlight, and they were only on the high side of passable. Giovanni Ribisi plays an extremely convincing coke-head, and his performance was probably the chaotic highlight of the movie. It's a semi-fun crime-dramedy with a couple of memorable scenes that just doesn't quite make it over the top for me. It was just average. &quot;High-end average&quot; would be a stretch.</quote>

  <quote>I never thought I'd leave a Tarantino movie feeling so... unfulfilled. I get it, I understand the references... it's just not much of a movie. Nothing really happens, and even THAT can be done well, but outside of Pitt and Leo having a ball, the ending, and the direction... this is a 165-minute meatless bone. It seems more concerned with name-dropping and being referential, than with any kind of narrative. I have no doubt this is exactly the movie that Tarantino wanted; it's just not for me.</quote>

  <quote>Shut up, Gottfried. It's possible that this is not the genre for me, or, this just isn't a great example of it. There's some tension and laughs but I can't help feeling like I'm on Twitter with all these segues and side-bars -- due in no small part to the fact that these are all horrible people with single-minded characters, most of whom lack much interest within that paradigm, which would make their characters more enjoyable. Cillian Murphy as a cocaine-snorting record-player DJ is a highlight.</quote>

  <quote>Originally I was vibing with this. In hindsight, not so much. I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that Poltergeist is a good movie, or that it was worth remaking (has the original aged SO POORLY as to deem this a good idea/necessary/worth spending $35mil on?). There's nothing in this movie that breaks new ground, but at the same time it wasn't AWFUL to me. I quite liked the CGI but the 3D &amp;amp; other effects were mostly a waste. Paper-thin characters. Very formulaic, even for a remake. Safe to skip!</quote>

  <quote>The entire movie is built on Woody's performance, and on that alone it's worthy of a pass and a viewing. I can't say with any kind of confidence that it's a GOOD movie - rather, it's a movie with a large number of scenes which are good on their own, but make for something of an average ensemble. As far as crime dramas go, it's probably a bit above-average, but quite frankly, I found a lot of the other characters to be repetitive and single-minded. Again, flick is made by Woody's performance.</quote>

Valerie enlists the help of a veteran demon hunter (Gary Oldman) to destroy the creature, but as each cycle of the moon brings fresh deaths, Valerie begins to realize that the murderous beast may be closer to her than she'd ever dreamed.</summary>
  <quote>I was digging this quite a bit actually until the last 20-ish minutes. Great costume and art design, a relatively-mundane script, but another example of convention done fairly well. But oh God, the ending. So fucking terrible. No fault to the actors, just, really pisspoor writing. So there's ups and downs. The ups of course once again include the character portrayed by Ms. Seyfried (Y'know what, say what you will, but she's underrated.) The downs of course are headlined by the God-awful ending.</quote>

  <quote>Everyone in this movie is strong-arming everyone else, every fight scene looks like it was choreographed that morning, and like a lot of these movies, character motivations/actions/statements are often spotty at best and silly at worst.

Also does that thing that a lot of pedestrian action-thrillers do which is set up for a sequel that's never coming. It has an audience, but doesn't stand out in any way.</quote>

Too long, too convoluted, cuts the nuts off of evil Prime, too genre-diverse (without being incredible at any of them) and far away from what would make these movies great.

  <quote>I'm okay with this. Visually, it's very lovely and fleshed-out for the most part. Honestly, could have done without the CGI &quot;Gremlins&quot; rip-offs, I think it would have gone over much better had they been a &quot;faceless unseen fear&quot; sort of thing. But, they decided on CGI gremlins, so, there you have it. This movie is a moving poster for bad parenting; I dunno if they were going for that or it was just poorly-written characters. Katie and Guy do enough, while Bailee is creepy as fuck. It's passable.</quote>

  <quote>There's some stuff in here that definitely works and is at least a good IDEA, even if in execution it leaves quite a bit to be desired. But if there ever was a well that had been bled dry, it's the found-footage horror movie. I just think that a movie like this is too derivative of its predecessors to be anything more than inoffensive. There are some cool scenes bogged down by all-world terrible dialogue and a male co-lead who is an asshole for NO reason. I'll play nice with the ending. Skip.</quote>

  <quote>I actually didn't mind this flick all that much, it's average, and the rating is saved a bit by a really cool (albeit brief) ending credits sequence, with some photos that may lead you to question whether they're real scene photos or props. And it had kind of a decent twist towards the end. But yo, if you're not a fan of jump-scares, you can pretty much skip this flick entirely, as that's 80% of the flick. And they're often really cheap jump scares, with very little thought involved. Passable.</quote>

I pay attention only to attempt to extrapolate the continuation of the story, but that's starting to not cut it anymore. But since I'm a sissy the scares worked.</quote>

  <quote>It's pretty dumb. Feels like they were really trying to go for some A-Team shit. The dialogue is hit-and-miss between funny, charming &amp;amp; genuine, and stupid, cliched &amp;amp; generally terrible. It does a few scarce moments of tension fairly well, and definitely has an edge to it. The movie's best shot at sentimentality with the storyline of John and his family is totally undercut when he has sex with the homocide PI. The movie gets willfully dumber from there, all the way to its &quot;okay&quot; conclusion.</quote>

It is what it is, but, what it is isn't overly strong or memorable.</quote>

The actual film itself is not that bad, it gets the grittiness and the dread down pat for sure. As a whole, though, it feels disjointed and insistent on itself. But, watch it.</quote>

  <quote>One of the least inspired action/sci-fi flicks I think I've ever seen. It was painfully obvious that it was made by the same guys who made Crank, as, aside from the ballsy action scenes and pseudo-dystopianism, the movie was annoying. People actually liked the &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; dance-ologue? It was hammy, but dumb. I also HATED the way the movie characterizes the only two &quot;gamers&quot; you meet -- a morbidly obese pervert and an underage boy using his parents' money. Maybe a cult fave...?</quote>

  <quote>Feels very much like Perry's best shot at actually BEING Woody Allen. Not un-enjoyable, but even at its apex(es) it's not exactly what I would describe as an entertaining film. I'm fine with heavy dialogue (though hit-and-miss here in terms of quality), but I do prefer that dialogue to come from characters whose inter-relationships intrigue me. To me this is a group of unlikable, pretentious, melodramatic people. That just doesn't hook me, intentional or not. It's more annoying than investing.</quote>

  <quote>It's gotten to the point that movies like Ice Age are ones I can sit through, but that offer me little in terms of entertainment. Laughs? Absolutely. Emotional subject matter? Yes, albeit tacked on and completely superficial. Let's face it, these are movies for the kids and nothing more. Maybe it didn't help that I haven't seen the second or third movies, but even so, it wouldn't change the things about this movie that annoyed me. Some good voice acting, but some was terribly distracting. Meh.</quote>

  <quote>I'll see anything with Damon in it (human or puppet), and I thought this movie had potential. It sadly left me with a &quot;what's the point?&quot; empty feeling.

As conflicting paths and ideals test their relationship, Sophia and Luke make an unexpected and fateful connection with Ira, whose memories of his own decades-long romance with his beloved wife deeply inspire the young couple.

  <quote>Honestly, probably better than it had any right to be. Not GOOD, I'm not gonna say that, but, not a complete train-wreck by any means either. Alan Alda is the flick's MVP, which is either a good thing (because he's good in his role), a bad thing (because he's not the primary focus of the movie), or an expectation (because it's Alan fucking Alda). Bull riding is bullshit and if you like it you're a horrible person. That's fact. But if you like(d) this movie I can't really blame you. It's alright!</quote>

Amidst the tranquil sway of the farm&amp;amp;#039;s field of sunflowers, Jess, 16, soon realizes how terrifying seclusion can be when she and her brother Ben, 3, begin seeing ominous apparitions invisible to everyone else.  (Sony)</summary>
  <quote>EXTREMELY conventional for a 2007 horror. The CGI apparitions looked terrible, but John Corbett's character was quite good, and of course, Kristen Stewart and her 16-year-old sexually-frustrated looks sold it. The twist was cool if predictable. I won't totally shit on it, it's just trying to cash in on the horror movie bandwagon. But given that I had been waiting a couple years to see it, I was somewhat disappointed. I expected more. But the crawling scene in the barn creeps me the fuck out.</quote>

  <quote>This isn't the original Conjuring, not by a long shot. I feel like I've reached that point with this franchise that I have with Paranormal Activity: the main reason I'm watching is to keep track of the lore, which, isn't really a great reason to be watching if we're being honest. The highlight was arguably when a grown-ass adult man turned around to a group of teenagers and told them to kill themselves and shut up. That's not in the movie, that was in my theatre. So you don't get to see that.</quote>

  <quote>I give it props for Ray Liotta, and the fact that it out-Blart'ed &quot;Paul Blart&quot; - good thing or bad?

That's really not a combination that leads to effective characterization, outside of Donnie Darko. Quite unfortunate as it kills Rogan's momentum; his recent roles (Z&amp;amp;M, Funny People, Superbad) have been gold. Clearly marks the end of Anna Faris' career.</quote>

We skip 17 years and the movie goes full Gladiator. Rich girls covertly swoon over shirtless, buff slaves. Horrible dialogue. CGI was hit-and-miss. Too much finger-biting. I guess they depict Pompeii well, and Kiefer is good. I believe that's where my praise ends, though.</quote>

  <quote>Extremely wonky if this indeed is NOT an intentional comedy. Some redeeming moments as well; Cage's &quot;walking nightmares&quot; kind of work, some fun dialogue, there's relative suspense, and it's always fun to see LeeLee. But the bees scene proves that Cage wasn't taking this seriously. But he sure can smack a bitch. The actual wicker man was a neat concept as far as sacrifices go. The original theatrical ending is better than the unrated one; more LeeLee! Y'know what, fuck it, see this movie.</quote>

  <summary>Nick Wild is a Las Vegas bodyguard with lethal professional skills and a personal gambling problem. When a friend is beaten by a sadistic thug, Nick strikes back, only to find out the thug is the son of a powerful mob boss. Suddenly Nick is plunged into the criminal underworld, chased by enforcers and wanted by the mob. Having raised the stakes, Nick has one last play to change his fortunes...and this time, it's all or nothing. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I don't think I can call this thing BAD. Just WILDLY inconsistent, if you'll forgive the pun. The weird tonal shifts I think will turn a lot of people off but I've seen less-interesting movies than this, and less-interesting takes on things like gambling addiction and being afraid of the world. But I will say this about Wild Card -- I was actually fairly bored for most of it. Even the fight scenes which I fear substitute slow-motion for ingenuity. You'll see worse this year but this isn't great.</quote>

  <summary>The movie is set in a world where dragons are hunted for oil. In an adaption of Moby Dick, we follow Ahab and his doomed crew in their hunt for the white dragon.</summary>
  <quote>Pretty bad CGI to start; the white dragon looks like something straight out of The Asylum's playbook, a &quot;we need a dragon but we only have 20-thou to spend&quot; sort of thing. Anyways. I give the film props for taking a classic tale and putting at least a somewhat-fascinating spin on it. Ahab was an interesting character; at the same time, protagonist and vengeance-fueled anti-hero. Some unneeded emotional tack-ons, but nothing too egregious. Don't shy away because of bad reviews. It's worth a look.</quote>

  <quote>&quot;Handi-cam&quot; style? Again? Alright. I'll give it this much, the early &quot;possession&quot; scene was pretty good; not *really* getting to see what happened was arguably better than seeing it. When you get to see what happens, you start to see the holes in it. Aside from that, this is fairly standard. There's not a lot in this movie that you haven't seen before, not to say that there aren't good moments. But almost every formula &amp;amp; convention of the genre is present.

  <quote>I can get behind Kevin Hart in this. He's got some really funny moments. Will Ferrell does what he usually does, to continuingly-diminishing returns. Comedy movies often try too hard to be &quot;more than just a comedy&quot;, and this has elements of that for sure. I don't think it helps the movie's case. This is not OFFENSIVELY bad. But it's a lot of lazy comedy with shoe-horned drama and extraneous story that simply isn't necessary. A mostly-pointless comedy becomes a completely-pointless dramedy.</quote>

  <quote>The first movie was forgettable outside of a few scenes and the ending. A decade later, I'll say that the sequel is far more memorable, largely for bad reasons. Laughably trope-drenched, a waste of its atmosphere, and more entertaining to mock than to consume. (Positive) highlights include the pool scene, the 80's vibe, and the soundtrack. (Negative) highlights include killers becoming T-1000's, no care being given to continuity, and a popcorn-fart of an ending. Watch for laughs, not for scares.</quote>

  <quote>While this movie is arguably more famous from the awesome review given to it by The Nostalgic Critic, than anything that it itself did, I do have to give it credit for some amazing laughs. It's obviously my kind of humor, and it doesn't surprise me that I only see 20 green-spectrum reviews out of my top 250. It's a bad movie, there's no getting around it, but it's too damn funny to hate on it. It gets a lowest-end Average from me due to its consistent ability to make me laugh. Cudos, Cappello.</quote>

There's some killer lines dropped into this not-so-great screenplay. Oh shit, Danny Glover up in this bitch! The acting is pretty stilted, but I can't exactly call it un-entertaining.

  <quote>Full disclosure, Vince Vaughn is pretty much poison to me. Tom Wilkinson was funny, but, even he can kind of wear thin. That's the whole story of this movie I think: it wears thin. To be fair, there are funny moments here that DO include Vaughn, but they're few and far between. Dave Franco didn't work for me from frame one. I guess at the end of the day, I didn't laugh nearly enough. There's drama, but, it's nothing captivating. So it didn't work as comedy OR dramedy for me. But hey... titties.</quote>

Cudos for the killer's death though, it was pretty badass.</quote>

There's a hell of a story to tell here. But it's undercut by really bad performances, and time-hopping that is, at best, detrimentally noticeable. I can, in the same instant, both appreciate this film's creative aim, and criticize its execution; the payoff didn't justify what you have to go through to get there.

  <quote>For the most part, this is pretty bad: the sun burns out in the first 20 minutes, every &quot;family meal&quot; is a tire fire, and none of the tension or anger or sadness is earned through quality of performance or storytelling. It's all random emotional outbursts without much depth worth mentioning. That's a shame, because the halfway point in the movie does kind of perk up a little, but never above treading water. One of the rare occasions where a longer runtime (pre sun burnout) would have helped.</quote>

  <quote>Now I miss arcades. I'm talking the big ones that turn kids into tiny gambling addicts. Thanks, movie. Speaking of the movie, I kinda wish I could just keep talking about arcades. There is tone flopping all over the place here - though I think for the most part it's filmed in a consistent way and is at least trying to get its atmosphere over. The characters might be good enough for most audiences but the narrative is mostly a failure. Nic Cage is Nic Cage, and this flick is what it is: not good.</quote>

There is SO much here that could have been done SO much better and given SO much more room to breathe. But mostly, it should have just not been done. Or hey - just give it to Marvel Studios.

Anyways, it's apparently an improvement from the last couple, but I mean... it's the same old shit. Skip it for sure.</quote>

  <quote>Positives: Ice Cube everything, Charlie Day about half the time, and Tracy Morgan in pieces. Unfortunately, Cube and Day can't save this thing. The great cardinal sin that a comedy -- a straight-up, comedy-only comedy -- can commit, is not being funny. This movie isn't funny, for giant stretches at a time. At best, you have sprinklings of laughter throughout 90+ minutes. The Big Sean scene is the only truly funny sequence. That, the mariachi band playing the Rocky theme, and parts of the fight.</quote>

  <quote>Y'know what... even my massive love for Ms. Seyfried cannot save this turd. I thought it was going to get a pass no matter what. Can't hate a shower scene in the first five minutes. Despite a good line or two, there is some painfully-bad dialogue. Her escape scenes are wonky. My main problem with the flick is it spends 80 minutes building towards a mostly-unsatisfying climax. If you can just enjoy tension-building for what it is, you'll probably dig that aspect. But as a whole, it's not good.</quote>

  <quote>Yeah y'know what, I'm not gonna defend this nearly as hard as I defended the first one. I think Marlon Wayans has this &quot;Seth MacFarlane&quot; thing going on where, the harder he tries and the farther he goes to make jokes happen, the flatter they fall. This wasn't completely devoid of comedic merit (I love Gabriel Iglesias after all) and it isn't like it didn't have entertaining moments (though few and far-between), but even for a sequel, this is disappointingly flat compared to the first one for me.</quote>

  <quote>The second half of the movie is reduced to cliched, cartoon-ish, semi-interesting horror-flick impossibilities. But that's the second half. The FIRST half, is not about displaying the visual graphic-ness of a gang-rape, but so much more about the psychological torment of pre-rape torture. And it definitely pushes that envelope to a level I've never seen before. But I have to ask... what the fuck happened to the daughter? Is that a cliffhanger, or lazy writing? Can't bring myself to recommend it.</quote>

But, the ending totally blew the whole movie to shit. When Ali Larter, in a 6-minute span, goes from normal blonde girl, to Spiderman, to ECW pro wrestler, to dead, that's the point where I wash my hands of it. I want my $10 back.</quote>

Because it felt like every time you turned around he was stealing a car or breaking into a house *completely* undetected no matter how many people were around.

And not to sound like a blind hater, but goddamn does J-Lo ever suck in this. She's just not a good actress, and her whole sub-plot and story is not interesting. Pass.</quote>

  <summary>When Mae is hired to work for the world's largest and most powerful tech and social media company, she sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. As she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Bailey, to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes begin to affect the lives and future of her friends, family and that of humanity. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's disappointing to say the least that a movie with Tom Hanks, Emma Watson, Bill Paxton and John Boyega is so stilted and unconvincingly-performed. The Circle plays out as a subdued, shallow cartoon; the company itself, a millennial's wet dream place of employment; the story, a &quot;baby's first corruption&quot; big brother tale that wants desperately for you to believe it's saying so much more than it actually is. Don't worry: the moralistic white girl trope swoops in and saves the day. This is lazy.</quote>

  <quote>Have you seen Hunger Games or Maze Runner? Congratulations, you've also seen this! I foolishly thought, since we have some separation between now and when the YA film craze was at its peak, that maybe this movie would step outside the box and try to be different. Instead, it does nothing different, existing as a horribly derivative, formulaic nothing of a movie, with a screenplay that sounds like it was written on a cereal box. The final 15 minutes are worth watching, but not worth getting to.</quote>

  <quote>Wastes no time tossing the gore at you. The musical sub-genre of horror is a strange one, with the added dilemma of non-sympathetic, idiotic characters. Had to chuckle at the sign with the title of the movie in the middle of the woods. At least the Nick character is very interesting. Sadly, all atmosphere is blown inside 10 minutes when someone on the film crew's arm is in a shot and the editors just left it in. Inexcusable. Aside from Nick, the music and the ending, it's a poor effort.</quote>

  <quote>This movie ADDED writers (including the new director) and the writing got explicitly WORSE. That to me is unforgivable. It was mildly cool to see the continuation of the Nell character, but forget that, 'cuz costume paraaade! This doesn't have the same quality that the first film had. Even if it wasn't a sequel, I don't think it's a particularly good horror movie on its own. It doesn't build much tension and it isn't overly scary. The lore is only iffy. The last half-hour is almost hilarious.</quote>

  <quote>Assumed it was garbage. I first had to identify what I thought this movie was TRYING to be.

I kept waiting for this comedy to be funny. Mann is funny in parts but REAL annoying in others. Diaz still rocks sexy. Upton can't act... shocking. Fuck Nicki Minaj. The plot is insulting and the ending is formulaic. So... garbage! Nailed it.</quote>

  <quote>Even if you take away the fact that the trailer for this flick totally spills the beans - basically, if you watch the trailer, you've watched the movie - even if that's taken away and the trailer is viral and gives nothing away, the flick is as transparent as it gets. There's no suspense whatsoever, after the first five minutes you can essentially call it right to the finish. Unreliable characters that you can't get behind, predictable eye candy, and an antagonist that just fails. Poor effort.</quote>

  <quote>A 100-minute mumble-fest; there are very few clean, audible lines in the entire flick, and where, with &quot;Rocky&quot;, that's lovable, here it's just annoying. Didn't find myself attached to ANY characters, wasn't convinced by their inter-relationships, and most of the fighting had no technique, devolving into glorified bar-fights (save the fight with Cung Le, but he's an actual MMA guy, so that makes sense). In short, too much of this flick felt phoned in, and it failed to entertain me on any level.</quote>

  <summary>Pregnant with director Roman Polanski's child and awaiting his return from Europe, 26-year-old Hollywood actress Sharon Tate becomes plagued by visions of her imminent death.</summary>
  <quote>We're ten minutes in before any lines are spoken one character to another. There's build-up, and then there's just plain wasting time. Anyway, Hillary Duff is an interesting casting choice for Tate, but it's tough to get past the (admittedly-occasional) dollar-store philosophy and almost goofy (certainly not tense) tactics of the Manson killers. Eventually this falls off the rails into a fleetingly-interesting home invasion that retcons itself at break-neck speed. Is &quot;pointless&quot; too harsh here?</quote>

  <quote>The main thing that makes movies like this enjoyable is not the gross-out or physical comedy, it's having investment-worthy characters getting themselves into those situations. That's why similar movies like Hangover &amp;amp; Superbad work so well, and this one doesn't. Inside 5 minutes the characters mostly display themselves as disposable Superbad ripoffs. The fingerbanging lines, finding the dildo &amp;amp; &quot;ninjas are pussies&quot; were the only laughs. First 20 minutes, very pointless. Not worth the full 90.</quote>

  <summary>Robert is an ordinary man who is faced with extraordinary circumstances. He is locked in a meat freezer by Russian thugs who believe that he owes them 8 million dollars. Robert, who is in every frame of the film soon discovers that he is not alone in the freezer. Sam, a stranger, is also locked in with him, and it becomes a struggle to survive the cold and the forces that are against them (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>What the fuck did I just watch? Let's see... a non-sensical plot... missing subtitles... the movie itself can't even keep track of how cold it is (watch people breathe &amp;amp; speak)... idiotic characters who aren't convincing... Robert's idiotic cover (guy in a relationship who talks game about women who aren't his girlfriend). McDermott's shit performance doesn't help. Might have been better if Sam wasn't in the movie at all. This is total below-B-level weaksauce. The &quot;twist&quot; doesn't even save it.</quote>

  <quote>I can't help but feel like this was Adam Sandler's excuse to see mostly-naked chicks bounce around for a month. I am now officially obsessed with Kat Dennings, and &quot;Heff&quot; is so loveable. Other than that, this was a boring flick with interspersed one-liners about sex and swearing. Nobody is expecting a Coen Bros flick here, but goddamn. &quot;College&quot; is going to draw a lot of this flick's audience by givin 'em more bang for their buck in the genre. It's nice to see Anna Faris every once in awhile.</quote>

  <quote>For the first time in a long time, I am STARTING my rating at 0 and working up, based solely on the first 2 minutes (no pun intended), which is nothing but derivative garbage written by middle-aged men trying to remember what it's like to be a teenager. Reading interviews, the director's inspiration is heartfelt 80's teen movies. Well, Dan, you missed the boat with this mostly-heartless dribble. 5 points for masturbating to get out of trouble, and a few funny lines &amp;amp; scenes. Otherwise, terrible.</quote>

  <summary>When an American home improvement TV show visits a remote Eastern European village, the young crew thinks the lack of mocha lattÃ©s and free wifi will be the worst of their problems. But after their filming interrupts the superstitious villagers' private religious ritual, the situation takes a turn for the homicidal... and when the blood starts flowing, that's when things get really weird.</summary>
  <quote>There's this thing that indie movies do - especially horror - which is to make one/two characters complete cockbags for no reason. Takes 40mins to get going. The main thing about the horror-comedy is: it's supposed to be tense, funny and scary. This is almost never these things; it's more annoying than anything. 2mins of character development gives way to obligatory sex. This is lazy, derivative of better movies, unfocused, and the climactic special effects are atrocious. Put bluntly, this blew.</quote>

  <quote>Way up there among the worst big-budget Sci-Fi I've ever seen. Looks fine, and has some interesting genre elements that it thoroughly underexamines or ignores, but in virtually all other ways, &quot;Valerian&quot; is Sci-Fi's limp penis. Horrible screenplay, absolutely no fun at all, mostly-sluggish action, with leads that couldn't have less chemistry if they actively tried, phoning in a romance that would put Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet's timeline to shame. Zero investment or reason to pay attention. Utter garbage.</quote>

  <summary>From the creators of Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans comes a spoof of pop culture and teenage vampire movies starring Jenn Proske as Becca, a high schooler who must choose between two hunky boys who both have killer smiles. While surrounded by vampires, werewolves (wereChihuahuas, anyone?) and gossipy teens with their own romantic dilemmas, the neurotic Becca also copes with her overprotective father and the school's impending prom.</summary>
  <quote>Here's what I liked. 1: Only 1h20m long. 2: Diedrich Bader. 3: Jenn Proske actually plays a really convincing Bella clone. In all truthfulness, this movie blew. It sucked big pointy rocks. It stunk up the place really badly. When you're doing a satire, with source material like Twilight, and your jokes aren't funny, your actors aren't right for your genre, and your pop culture references are stale, you fucked up. Blam this piece of fucking shit. I banish your DVD to the yard sales of tomorrow.</quote>

  <quote>Here it is, folks! Quite possibly THE WORST thing ever filmed, and this coming from a man who has seen lots of porn. The moral? Gang-raping your Japanese girlfriend because she is too clingy (and filming it) is bad because she might kill herself and come back and haunt you and your pretty new Caucasian bride. This is not one-percent exaggerated; that IS the plot of this movie. Be smart, kids - don't rape your Japanese girlfriend and film it. And whatever you do, do NOT see 'Shutter', either.</quote>
