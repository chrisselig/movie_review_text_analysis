  <summary>A unique cinematic journey, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; travels across enormous distances of both space and time. The story it tells is on the one hand about the collective adventure of human life on and off this planet. But it is also about something lying beyond the bounds of humanity, something lying in the true realms of the mysterious.</summary>
  <quote>A remarkable journey that displays some of the most brilliant cinematography and photography to ever grace the screen. It's a slow-burning visual narrative of the evolution of man; one that isn't afraid to ask questions and offer up mind-bending possibilities. It's a film that begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. The atmosphere, soundtrack and special effects are all-encompassing for the viewer who is willing to strap theirself in for an intense examination of humanity. Essential.</quote>

  <summary>Welcome to the world's most notorious slum: Rio de Janeiro's 'City of God.' A place where combat photographers fear to tread, where Police rarely go, and residents are lucky if they live to the age of 20.  This is the true story of a young man who grew up on these streets and whose ambition as a photographer is our window in and ultimately may be his only way out. [Original Release 2002] (Miramax)</summary>
  <quote>A tremendous film based on true stories about youths growing up in dangerous Rio de Janeiro neighborhoods. Some fall victim to the violence and drug culture while others look for any way to escape it. Our lead, Rocket, finds peace through the lens of a camera, becoming a freelance photographer. The acting is superb and the camera work is some of the greatest of the 21st century. With great influences over camera angles and film-styling, its a bench-mark film both emotionally and technically.</quote>

  <summary>A savage and satiric morality play centering on Alex, who fights, robs, rapes and kills like any conscienceless predator. Captured and imprisoned, he undergoes treatment to condition him &quot;safe&quot;, a &quot;clockwork orange&quot; healthy and whole on the outside - but crippled within by reflex mechanisms beyond his control.</summary>
  <quote>Unique, bizarre and unimaginably influential. This film was so pioneering that it continues to be one of the most stylish and interesting movies of all-time, even nearly half-a-century later. In many ways it exists, much like its main character Alex, in an altered reality. It's an inquisition of the human psyche and its fascination with violence and suffering. It's a dystopian dissection of gang mentality in a world of experimental mind modification. Few films reach this level of introspection.</quote>

  <summary>Joel (Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine (Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased.  Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Wilkinson), to have Clementine removed from his own memory.  But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover his love for Clementine.  (Focus Features)</summary>
  <quote>Genius. My favorite movie and one that gets better with repeat viewings; I discover something new each time. Winslet and Carrey are in top form as the erratic, dynamic couple who decide to erase each other from their memories. While the technical/psychological showcase of the erasure process makes this a spectacle to behold, it wouldn't have been nearly as effective without its strong emotional core. Eternal Sunshine is a unique love story for the ages and one that everyone should experience.</quote>

  <summary>Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged... (Paramount Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>The pinnacle of American film making. The acting, the scenery, the dialogue and music... It has inspired (for better or for worse) thousands of young men's obsession with the mob and the gangster lifestyle. This deserves a more proper review - this is just a place holder.</quote>

  <summary>The sequel to &amp;amp;#034;The Godfather&amp;amp;#034; continues the saga of two generations of successive power within the Corleone family. Coppola tells two stories in Part II: the roots and rise of a young Don Vito, played with uncanny ability by Robert De Niro, and the ascension of Michael (Al Pacino) as the new Don. (Paramount)</summary>
  <quote>The greatest sequel of all-time. It's quieter than Pt 1. at times, more driven by script and dialogue, but it's also more relevant historically with a political and socioeconomic focus on the dual time periods covered. DeNiro and Pacino are both sensational and the tense, powerful moments are just as iconic as in the original. Honestly, I don't even view them as separate films because I never watch one without the other.</quote>

  <summary>Three gunmen set out to find a hidden fortune. Who will walk away with the cash? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Simply put: one of the greatest movies of all-time. The music, camera work and general badassery of Clint's &quot;Man With No Name&quot; are all so iconic and influential that it's almost impossible to judge the film objectively. The scale of this adventure is enormous and all the main characters are unforgettable. Interesting that one of the defining moments in American pop culture isn't even American-made, but Leone's vision is a brilliant exposition on the morals and motivations of the American man.</quote>

The once-great kingdom, watched over by a fading steward, has never been in more desperate need of its king. But can Aragorn (Mortensen) answer the call of his heritage and become what he was born to be? In no small measure, the fate of Middle-earth rests on his broad shoulders. (New Line Cinema)</summary>
  <quote>Its execution is so technically perfect, yet it's the emotional core of the storytelling that makes it exceptional. Not only is this a brilliant conclusion to one of the greatest fantasy film franchises of all-time, it also stands alone as one of the finest movies of any genre to ever be produced. From the monumental scale of the sets to the powerhouse performances; from the sweeping musical score to the epic battle scenes... when it comes to film artistry, it doesn't get much better than this.</quote>

  <summary>Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are two hitmen who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch Coolidge is an aging boxer paid by Wallace to lose his next fight. The lives of these and other characters prove to be woven together in ways none of them could ever fully understand.</summary>
  <quote>It sounds trite to call this cool, but I do believe it's the very definition of the word. No other film made in the 1990s is as culturally/cinematically influential or interesting. The script is loaded with sharp-as-a-tack dialogue; some brilliant, some funny, some entirely thought-provoking. Possibly the greatest ensemble cast of all-time, with a dozen unique (and developed) characters. Additionally, the unique style of editing and entertaining story make it a treat for endless repeat viewings.</quote>

  <quote>The perfect adventure film! Harrison Ford is unforgettable as the intelligent and charming archaeologist who will stop at nothing to protect the ancient relics of the world. It takes cues from classic 1940s westerns and treasure-hunting movies and combines their best traits with electric humor, rowdy excitement and a compelling story. Add a notoriously brilliant soundtrack, flawlessly executed action sequences and a stellar cast? You get this gem. Dr. Jones never lets up and never lets you down.</quote>

  <summary>Steven Spielberg's epic drama tells the compelling true story of German businessman Oskar Schindler (Neeson) who comes to Nazi-occupied Poland looking for economic prosperity and leaves as a savior. (History in Film)</summary>
  <quote>There are few examples of a more perfectly made film. In some ways it's very linear/heavy-handed and a big-studio production about the Holocaust seems potentially hollow, but at the same time the topic of art should not be limited. Spielberg's work on this film represents his greatest technical achievement as a director and the emotional punch this film delivers is one that stays with you for years. Though history owes much more to the topic than a dramatic film, this isn't a bad place to start.</quote>

  <quote>The term masterpiece is often overused, but not here. This is a superb example of film making. The landscapes, the vivid colors and camera work... It's a 21st century Citizen Kane; an intense character piece. Some scenes can go 5 to 10 minutes with very little dialogue, yet small details can be questioned and examined for months. Time will only increase the significance of this film and Daniel Day-Lewis continues to prove that he is one of the greatest actors to ever appear on the silver screen.</quote>

  <quote>Entire college-level courses could be taught based on this unforgettable slice of cinema; both on the subject of film and in men's studies.

Edward Norton is as perfect as an actor can be and this finally made it OK for guys to love Brad Pitt. It's violent and very dark, but the dialogue and existential criticism is brilliant.

  <quote>One of the best sci-fi films of all-time and easily the best Star Wars movie. The script is tight, the characters are more developed than in the original and the action moves along at a surprising clip. Even as my love for Star Wars wanes a bit as I get older and experience more enlightened works of cinema, this one still stands out as a benchmark in action films. There are so many memorable scenes and the darker tone with real struggles on both sides of the battle set this apart from its genre.</quote>

  <quote>Many say that FMJ is two films in one, featuring a superior first half. I'd argue that the movie accurately transitions our Marines from the psychological drilling of boot camp to the physical horrors of war. For me, the first half helped me know the characters and resulted in a greater emotional impact during the second half. Beyond the incredible direction and cinematography, this movie has more memorable lines than any other war film. It stands alongside Apocalypse Now as a Vietnam must-see.</quote>

  <summary>Atticus Finch, a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge and his kids against prejudice. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A flawless example of proper page-to-screen adaptation. The classic novel of truth and justice in the face of extreme prejudice is made even more dramatic by powerful images. Gregory Peck is unforgettable as Atticus Finch. In this character lies a heroic example of exceptional American masculinity and morality (I was so inspired that my son's middle name is Atticus). Beyond the great story, the film is a beauty and the methodical delivery of scenes through a child's point-of-view is ingenious.</quote>

  <summary>In 1941, New York intellectual playwright Barton Fink comes to Hollywood to write a Wallace Beery wrestling picture. Staying in the eerie Hotel Earle, Barton develops severe writer's block. His neighbor, jovial insurance salesman Charlie Meadows, tries to help, but Barton continues to struggle as a bizarre sequence of events distracts him even further from his task. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A brilliantly self-aware &amp;amp; allegeorical thriller about writing and the Hollywood experience. It's often described as a comedy, and while there are a few humorous moments, it's actually quite somber and reflective. The set pieces &amp;amp; period appropriate atmosphere are impeccable. The mix of surrealism and crime noir create a unique film experience. Turturro is great, but this might be John Goodman's greatest performance. He steals the show.</quote>

(MGM)</summary>
  <quote>I still haven't decided if I was crushed or uplifted by the ending, but I do know that I was thoroughly impressed with the script. This is some of the most thought-provoking material Woody has ever penned and there are moments that transcend several genres (comedy, drama, thriller) without the slightest bump in thematic presentation. The seemingly unrelated stories come together in the final moments and leave us with tragic truths about humanity and our intensely flawed sense of reason/morality.</quote>

Well-scripted discussions of morality, honor &amp;amp; respect make the complicated relationship between rancher and outlaw grow at a believable pace.

  <summary>The lives of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, author Susan Orlean and orchid poacher John Laroche become strangely intertwined as each one's search for passion collides with the others' in this adaptation of the best-selling &quot;The Orchid Thief.&quot;</summary>
  <quote>Having read 'The Orchid Thief' just before seeing the film, I see Kaufman's handling of the idea of adaptation as a beautiful homage to the pyschological nature of Orleans' narrative journalism. It also serves as a second-hand guide to the cult of Orchid hunters - rather than just the 'movie version' of the book. Nicolas Cage is unforgettable in a challenging role as the Kaufman 'twins,' but Chris Cooper steals the show, bringing Laroche to life exactly the way I had imagined him in the text.</quote>

  <quote>Absolutely flawless direction by Lynch. MacLachlan represents the fleeting innocence of an America-gone-by as his character is drawn into a seedy underworld by a well-natured, but naive curiosity. A fairly straightforward mystery plot is thickened by the unforgettable characters he encounters. Hopper's turn as the psychopath Frank is disturbing in all its sick glory and Rossellini's performance screams of twisted desperation. Topped off with a great soundtrack and sharp visuals, it's hypnotic.</quote>

It's a throw-back to the popularity of comics and sci-fi in the 50s, and the nods towards McCarthyism and the Red Scare are nice touches that elevate this beyond a kid's movie. Terrific script with a touching, perfect ending.</quote>

  <quote>No matter how many times this movie comes on cable, you can't help but watch it every time. It's one of the great ones, with a legendary script and flawless direction. Over-exposure has hurt it's reputation some, but that's only because basically everyone has seen it. Some will criticize the ending, but every now and then we need a beautifully told story of triumph and redemption.</quote>

  <summary>From the legendary director Hayao Miyazaki (&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;) (Studio Ghibli), this film follows the fanciful adventures of a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro, who discovers a secret world when she and her family get lost and venture through a hillside tunnel.</summary>
  <quote>Quite possibly the most unique animated film of all-time, it's a masterwork of genius writer/director Hayao Miyazaki.  The story of a young girl who discovers a secret, magical world ruled by witches and monsters where humans are turned into animals. The imagination that it took to create this film is nothing short of mind-blowing. The animation is truly a sight to behold and the characters are some of the most unique and memorable in film history.</quote>

  <summary>A groundbreaking controversial drama about the tragic consequences of racism in a family.  (New Line Cinema)</summary>
  <quote>This movie would risk being a liberal anti-racism infomercial if it weren't for the phenomenal performance from Edward Norton. I'll admit, I was in high school when I first saw this and it had an immediate impression. A number of scenes, the ending especially, shocked me. Some of the characters may seem like over-the-top stereotypes, but these people really do exist. Ultimately, it's an intense and often violent film that puts all the drama up front, but the cast plays off the intensity so well.</quote>

  <summary>Three American brothers who have not spoken to each other in a year set off on a train voyage across India with a plan to find themselves and bond with each other -- to become brothers again like they used to be. Their &quot;spiritual quest&quot;, however, veers rapidly off-course (due to events involving over-the-counter pain killers, Indian cough syrup, and pepper spray), and they eventually find themselves stranded alone in the middle of the desert with eleven suitcases, a printer, and a laminating machine. At this moment, a new, unplanned journey suddenly begins. (Fox Searchlight)</summary>
  <quote>It's Anderson's usual style and the story is his most straight forward, yet this may be my favorite Wes. The camera work is tremendous and the mannerisms of the characters are idiosyncratic without being obnoxious. I was moved by their journey of self-discovery and even if it wasn't as poetic as the characters strived for, it was blunt, honest and touching. Wilson has never been better and breathes so much life into the protective big-brother who wants to be the parent his brothers never had.</quote>

  <quote>In some regards this is even more enjoyable than Raiders; it just doesn't have quite as many iconic moments to make it the defining piece of the franchise. It's epic in every sense of the word and features amazing scenery and photography. Crisp action, great dialogue and a thrilling story are all present. Connery and Ford are a perfect match as father &amp;amp; son, playing off each other to charming and hilarious results. The ending is (was) such a classic sendoff for one of cinema's greatest legends.</quote>

  <quote>Hard to judge objectively, it plays essentially like the most horrible home movie imaginable - but one everyone should see.

While today's audience may be more privy to graphic images that display the horrors of Nazi camps, it takes nothing from the shock of this timeless film.</quote>

If she fails, she will never prove herself to be the the true princess and will never see her real father, the king, again. (imdb)</summary>

The bleak atmosphere and unique character designs of this world are unforgettable. The story is gripping. This is fantasy film at it's dark, daring best.</quote>

  <summary>Opening with the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, members of the 2nd Ranger Battalion under Cpt. Miller fight ashore to secure a beachhead. Amidst the fighting, two brothers are killed in action. Earlier in New Guinea, a third brother is KIA. Their mother, Mrs. Ryan, is to receive all three of the grave telegrams on the same day... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Impressive war film, one of Spielberg's finest achievements. This is the type of movie that Americans should watch on the 4th of July or Veteran's Day. The action is gritty and the realism of the battles is unmatched - so much has been said of the scene on the beach, and for good reason. It's definitely a souped-up tribute to the troops, but it's not a pro-war film by any means. We are shown the soul-crushing reality of war first-hand. Led to 'Band of Bros.' and other emotional war dramas.</quote>

  <summary>A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future.</summary>
  <quote>No frills, no cheap scares, this is psychological horror at its finest. Much like the hotel, it creeps into your brain and makes you uncomfortable. The iconic scenes are classic Kubrick and the acting is pitch-perfect. Nicholson is legendary, but I don't think Danny gets enough credit for his performance; the realism weighs greatly on how believable the kid is and he does wonderfully. The sense of dread is overwhelming. Few films can match this level of atmosphere or visual ingenuity.</quote>

  <quote>For consideration as Pixar's most compelling masterpiece, Wall-E is a family film that transcends the genre. While pulling inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Brazil and other sci-fi standards that kids know nothing about, Wall-E manages to be amazingly original. Fred Willard is hilarious as a CEO from the past trying to help clean up a littered Earth. Brilliance is in the memorable and unique robot characters, who portray many human emotions better than some live actors could ever hope to.</quote>

  <quote>A benchmark sci-fi action film, shot with precision &amp;amp; directed with artistic flair. Few flix have ever looked so awesome. While Alien created the atmosphere, the sequel puts us right in the thick of it. Ripley's a fantastic female lead: brave, tactical, and a total badass- yet she retains her maternal instincts. For better or worse, dialogue and interaction of Cameron's rugged band of militant Alien hunters spawned character blueprints for dozens of future action movies. An intense visual treat.</quote>

The minimalist set-up of Dogville on stage is not only an interesting visual choice, it's also thematically symbolic of the thin walls and transparency that exist in a community this rustic. Amazing narration by Hurt takes this to a level of excellence. By the end the viewer is transformed and may find theirself looking in the mirror, questioning their own morals and feelings about what just unfurled before their eyes.</quote>

  <quote>What starts as a potentially pretentious film about white privilege directed by proud liberal Sean Penn turns into a picture that closely examines itself and its cast. Based on the true story of a cavalier vagabond who puts aside his material possessions to connect with nature, the main force of the film is terrific acting by Emile Hirsch and the haunting soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. A powerful film about a journey that many only dream of taking and learning more about yourself than you imagined.</quote>

  <quote>The most emotional film I had the pleasure of seeing in 2009.  It's packed with both joy and frustration, but in that way it was made perfectly.  There are times when you want to scream to Max how to make things better for the Wild Things, but then you realize that he's handling it exactly the way a 9 year old would.  It's dark, dialogue driven and probably won't be enjoyed by anyone under the age of 10.  But Jonze, much like Pixar, has taken a children's movie to the level of art.</quote>

  <quote>I thought it was great.  It's ridiculous, a tad pretentious, but the thoughts on economic inequality really strike home through the minimalist visual experience. Especially the burning on re-entry; you'll know what I mean once you see it. I applaud the choice of a female main character and several quotable lines have become instant favorites - particularly the line about &quot;now being the envy of the dead.&quot; The ending was terrific as well.</quote>

  <summary>An offbeat romantic comedy about a woman who doesn't believe true love exists, and the young man who falls for her.</summary>
  <quote>One of the greatest romantic comedies to come out of America, with dynamite performances from JGL and the always adorable Zooey D. We follow the story of a young man who believes in love, fate and destiny, who falls in love with the girl who denies all of it. The type of romantic film which can be enjoyed equally by both sexes with terrific dialogue and a rich soundtrack. The unique editing style works wonders (reality/expectations!) Some call it pretentious, but to me it feels authentic.</quote>

  <summary>Provoked by forbidden passions, Lester Burnham (Spacey) decides to make a few changes in his rut of a life, changes that are less midlife crisis than adolescence reborn. The freer he gets, the happier he gets, which is even more maddening to his wife, Carolyn (Bening), and daughter Jane (Birch) --especially when he turns his lustful gaze toward Jane's friend, the sultry Angela (Suvari).  (Dreamworks SKG)</summary>
  <quote>Some argue that the film isn't as daring or controversial as it intends to be, and that may be true to an extent. However, the atmosphere alone creates a tense and uncomfortable vision that puts emphasis on the duality of Subarban life; more specifically, it makes effective use of lighting to display the difference in superficial appearance (daytime) and the darker truths (nighttime). Heavy handed at times and a little full of itself, it's still a benchmark American film &amp;amp; Spacey is brilliant.</quote>

When he was a young boy, William Wallace's father and brother, along with many others, lost their lives trying to free Scotland. Once he loses another of his loved ones, William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Mel's greatest achievement and an ode to manliness/violence/freedom. It's as much a film about America as it is the Scottish rebellion. Moreso than an accurate historical piece, it's a folk tale that raises a man of honor to the level of legend. Those that criticize Gibson for glorifying himself as both director and star need to be honest with themselves: you would do the same thing, given the opportunity. With phenomenal battle scenes and a sweeping orchestrated score, it's a bombastic force.</quote>

Just like the books that Suzy reads, it's a charming fantasy that mixes reality and the imaginary.</quote>

  <quote>Somewhere between 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'The Hurt Locker' on the spectrum of U.S. political war films lies this bizarre jewel. It's a darkly comic treasure-hunting adventure injected with a sobering dose of war-time realism. It's an allegory for the past 30 years of American involvement in the Middle East, but also a study of moral judgment and global camaraderie. Unique visual effects and a war-reporter filming style have proved influential and, amazingly, the story is just as relevant today.</quote>

  <summary>A drama centered on retired professional wrestler Randy &quot;The Ram&quot; Robinson (Rourke) as he makes his way through the independent circuit, trying to get back in the game for one final showdown with his former rival. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Mickey Rourke is heartbreaking in this low-key production about the life of a former pro wrestling star. I'm not a wrestling fan, yet The Ram's story gripped me in a way few films have. The raw documentary style bucks the trend of traditional sports dramas. We feel his pain as he sacrifices his health, alienates his daughter and ends up losing everything important. His lone refuge is the delicate friendship with a middle-aged exotic dancer played to depressing reality by Marisa Tomei.</quote>

  <quote>One of the most ridiculous scripts ever, but it's a brilliant commentary on self-depreciation and obsession with celebrity. Not only does it have unique style, dialogue and camera work, but it takes big name actors and has them playing atypical characters. Screenwriter Kaufman has a knack for darkly psychological introspection and this takes it to a whole 'nother level on the meta scale. John Malkovich himself is faced with an imposing and schizophrenic performance, but he plays it perfectly.</quote>

  <quote>One of a few movies that I instantly think of when asked 'What's the funniest movie you've ever seen?' It's just as much a part of the grunge phenomenon as any of the music that came out in the early 90s and it reflects the thoughts of a generation of smart, but under-motivated working-class skeptics. There are so many ridiculous lines of dialogue and though the acting is pretty iffy at times, the comedic timing still makes this something special. A significant and influential independent film.</quote>

  <quote>Waltz/Jackson fit the Tarantino mold so wonderfully and the supporting cast nails their parts. The first 80% of the film is perfect spaghetti exploitation, ranking among the best Westerns I've ever seen, but a few scenes near the end drastically shift the pace and celebrate the violence a tad much. Still, the takeaway from this bold, bloody revenge flick is the tight script with tremendous commentary on the institution of slavery and racism; primarily in juxtaposed Dr. King/Stephen characters.</quote>

When he speaks, it's with a purpose; when he looks you in the eye, you damn well better listen. His bold, visceral reactions may shock, but show that he has a heart. There's a slick 80s style from the synth-pop soundtrack and hot-pink font, to Driver's scorpion bomber jacket. It's a sexy film without any sex; it's violent, though that violence happens in quick spikes. Daring and unforgettable.</quote>

Interestingly, Anderson's style and dialogue seem to work even better presented via animation. And that stop-motion work is astounding!

Our own moral compass is stretched to its limit. We're asked 'what would you do?' and then, at our most vulnerable, we're called to the witness stand.</quote>

  <summary>The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of &quot;Who Wants to be A Millionaire?&quot; -- an endeavor made without prize money in mind, rather, an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show.</summary>
  <quote>One of the greatest &quot;feel-good&quot; movies I've ever seen. In paying visual homage to 1999's incredible &quot;City of God,&quot; Director Danny Boyle manages the near impossible: An even balance of sharp dialogue, hopeless romanticism, humor, intense violence and haunting beauty. The chemistry of the actors on screen was perfect and the thunderous soundtrack constantly impressed. While not as brilliant as some recent best picture nominees, Slumdog was the best and most memorable film experience of 2008.</quote>

  <summary>On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. </summary>
  <quote>A movie about Facebook defines a generation? Yes, but the movie isn't nearly about Facebook as much as it is about our culture and reliance on social media, the quest for power and the crippling need for approval to make us feel like we have a purpose. The film, brilliantly directed by David Fincher, examines our relationships and how fragile the line can be between friend and leech.  Exploiting that line may in time prove to be the defining characteristic of social networking.</quote>

  <quote>For Generation Y American males, this was one of the movies we watched again and again as kids. The fact that it's rated R for language, intense moments and some drinking/smoking doesn't matter because it's genuine. This is how kids act, how they talk. They can be crass, but occasionally philosophical and deep. No film since has an ensemble cast of youngsters giving such stirring, heartfelt performances. It's a slice of true Americana and the ultimate coming-of-age story for adolescent boys.</quote>

Luke Skywalker (Hamill) and Captain Han Solo (Ford) team together with the lovable droid duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. (20th Century Fox)</summary>
  <quote>That moment when the music starts and you see those scrolling words; it's iconic. There's no other word for it. It was a labor of love, something even George Lucas himself seems to have forgot. Small budget, painstaking model work and pioneering special effects that could have broke Lucas forever, but instead turned him into a billionaire. The story is formulaic, but the strength lies in memorable character actors like Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness who turn corny dialogue into classic quotes.</quote>

  <summary>Davis Guggenheim reminds us that education &quot;statistics&quot; have names: Anthony, Francisco, Bianca, Daisy, and Emily, whose stories make up the engrossing foundation of WAITING FOR SUPERMAN. As he follows a handful of promising kids through a system that inhibits, rather than encourages, academic growth, Guggenheim undertakes an exhaustive review of public education, surveying &quot;drop-out factories&quot; and &quot;academic sinkholes,&quot; methodically dissecting the system and its seemingly intractable problems.</summary>
  <quote>Of the handful of recent documentaries on the American education system I have seen, this one is by far the most developed and balanced in terms of political and social bias.  Though teachers unions receive much of the negative attention here, there is no one group that has been singled out, or pardoned, as the party responsible for low school performances.  While some go straight for the heart with over-emotional pap and others come off too dry and numerical, this film finds a perfect medium.</quote>

  <quote>Alien has a thicker, creepier atmosphere than any film released before it. Even if you've had some of the iconic scenes spoiled for you, it's still a terrifying and claustrophobic thriller that is best enjoyed in the dark with surround sound. The art direction, scene design, character models and camera work are unforgettable - essentially every Sci-Fi (or survival horror) movie since has been inspired by the way this classic looks, sounds and feels. Also, Sigourney is a badass who loves cats!</quote>

  <quote>This movie is like a course in overcoming the troubles of inner-city life and Furious Styles (Fishburne) is our seasoned professor.

While recent works provide deeper, more intense looks at the 'hood,' this was a bold and influential release that still speaks to a young male audience.</quote>

However, this saga has always been about Harry and Voldemort's connection and the mystery of Snape. On these accounts, it excels. Fiennes and Rickman are perfect. The opaque atmosphere fits the desperation and horror surrounding the story's bold, brilliant end.</quote>

  <quote>Few modern noirs are as effective and even fewer perfectly capture the essence of a crime novel (moreso than historical realism). The dialogue sizzles and the action pops. The music makes you want to snap your fingers. The cinematography and set design really bring to life that L.A. mystique that was immortalized by old Hollywood. It's refreshing to see some of the leads play against character and the intricate plot lined with moral dilemmas keeps the tension alive up until the explosive ending.</quote>

  <summary>Little Miss Sunshine is an American family road comedy that shatters the mold. Brazenly satirical and yet deeply human, the film introduces audiences to one of the most endearingly fractured families in recent cinema history: the Hoovers, whose trip to a pre-pubescent beauty pageant results not only in comic mayhem but in death, transformation and a moving look at the surprising rewards of being losers in a winning-crazed culture.  (Fox Searchlight Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>This movie was like a delicious slab of funny stuffed in a depression pita.  A great dark comedy that follows a family through a rollercoaster road trip across half the country.</quote>

  <summary>When Jake LaMotta steps into a boxing ring and obliterates his opponent, he's a prizefighter portrayed in this Martin Scorsese film by Robert De Niro. But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>One of Scorsese's many masterpieces, it's also an acting clinic by Robert De Niro. His portrayal of Jake LaMotta is legendary, creating a character full of charisma and tenacity mixed with frightening psychopathy. The decision to shoot in black and white gives it a distinct documentary feel, though it's far too cinematic to be a strictly non-fiction presentation. The slow motion boxing sequences have been copied and parodied for decades now, but the masterful camera work still amaze.</quote>

  <quote>Reaches a very specific audience, but those of us that enjoy this kind of humor (mostly random &amp;amp; non-sensical) will find a few minutes of hilarity. The ending is unexpectedly meta and a little frightening, showing the degression of the artist's self-esteem and sanity. These quick segments provide plenty of quotable material and the success of this short film (an Academy award nomination) ironically influenced real-life commercials, including a campaign by PopTarts with a very similar art style.</quote>

  <quote>Hepburn and Peck are quite attractive, charming, and ooze chemistry. There are moments that are truly funny and others that are touching. The scenes in Rome are often breathtaking and much of the cinematography is beyond that of modern romantic comedies. The story of two opportunists who slowly develop feelings for one another has been rehashed numerous times since, but rarely in such a believable or heart-felt way. The final moments find us cautiously optimistic, staring at the screen on-edge.</quote>

  <quote>One of the handful of musicals that I thoroughly enjoy. The songs are all quite memorable, if not overly sugary and fantastical, but the fact that the script is able to juxtapose a jubilant family film against the historical backdrop of rising Nazi Germany has always impressed me. Though the children can be grating at times, Andrews is charming and lovely, as always, and Plummer helps to create a model male character for the silver screen; one who is masculine and strong, yet altogether loving.</quote>

  <quote>A monumental Italian epic, to be celebrated for it's cinematography and gigantic scope, if nothing else. Better dialogue and a polished focus on the politics would place this among the greatest films of all-time, but at points Bertolucci settles for cariactures and mild allegories for communism and fascism. At five hours long it's best to view each act in a separate sitting, which helps the audience soak in the story and study the history. It's bolstered by another terrific Morricone score.</quote>

  <quote>Easily one of the best of 2011. A silent film with the exception of one line of dialogue and a dream sequence, it's a homage to a different era of performance art. As such, it's a tour de force. Jean Dujardin is piercing, balancing the intense physical expressions of early cinema with the quiet and smoldering emotional restraint that is a trademark today. With great characters (Uggie the dog!), luminous music and a heartfelt love story, the refined charm of the film can not be stressed enough.</quote>

After a slowish start, the middle and end are by far some of the greatest moments in stand-up.</quote>

  <quote>It's almost technically perfect. The only complaint is it seems like there could have been more explored outside of the scientific drama specifically; it makes Episode 4 sort of feel out of place. One more episode with people dealing with life after the &quot;clean up&quot; would have provided even better closure than the text-heavy epilogue. However, it's a terrific and often horrifying production that answers lots of questions and makes the viewer want to research more about the event.</quote>

  <quote>This series has been the highlight of the MCU for me personally. I was hesitant going in, feeling a bit of that &quot;superhero fatigue&quot; that people have been talking about, but this show captivated me from the get-go. Totally different vibe than the movies; much darker, more realistic and serious. Season 1 was nearly flawless. Season 2 was still good, though I don't particularly care for Elektra or the &quot;Hand&quot; story arc.</quote>

  <summary>A tragic film covering a young boy and his little sister's struggle to survive in Japan during World War II.</summary>
  <quote>My wife won't even let me mention this movie, it made her so sad. It's a truly heartbreaking film about WW2 and I'd dare say it's essential viewing. Many people, Americans especially, don't think about how the people of Japan suffered during or after the war.</quote>

Some say the emotional content is hokey, but watching this with my family certainly added to the feels. Though the spiritual or philosophical depth may not be fully realized, the Nolans must be applauded for their ambition and success at popularizing such a difficult subject. At 3 hours, it rushes by and could stand to be even longer.</quote>

  <quote>Though not boasting a technological showcase of the ship compared to the '97 film, this adaptation of Walter Lord's thoroughly-researched novel follows the terrifying factual events of the night of the Titanic tragedy. The acting is tremendous, to the point that this nearly feels like a documentary. We get to know real people and experience their genuine fear. The lone historical flaw is the ship going under in one piece, but the splitting was not discovered until the wreckage was found in 1985.</quote>

  <quote>Perhaps the most self-aware musical of all-time. At a point in history when sing and dance movies were recycling paper-thin plots, this unique brand of artistic expression offers a gentle parody of Hollywood's transition to 'talkies.' Each musical number is elaborately choreographed and holds back nothing, a few times becoming self-indulgent (purposefully). The camera work is beyond impressive; superb cinematography especially during the veil performance. Honest comedy and beautiful scenery.</quote>

If the killer has confessed eight of these murders, he has always denied to be responsible for Margot's one. Anyway the specific mutilations found on her body made all doubts disappear...

  <quote>This is a very real, no-nonsense look at the impact of drug culture on rural, backwoods America. Many films look at inner-city violence and gangs, but Winter's Bone shows that these things can happen anywhere. It's Fargo meets Goodfellas. People can be trapped by what they know and own. Pride can be painful. Blood, when passed around too many times, gets really watered down. A tight and exciting script; Ree &amp;amp; Teardrop are instantly memorable characters. Depressing and hopeful at the same time.</quote>

  <quote>Belfort=modern day Caligula. No glorification, characters lack redeeming qualities aside from wealth: they're awful people with selfish motivations. Even their grandiose exploits are unattractive! Awkward sex scenes &amp;amp; rampant drug use (while often hilarious) brilliantly highlight dangers of abuse. Performance wise, DiCaprio &amp;amp; Hill are great; off-the-charts &amp;amp; insane. The greedy world Scorsese presents is massive &amp;amp; at times overwhelming; it's a very entertaining spiral, but not an enticing life.</quote>

  <quote>The greatest theater experience of my generation. In 3D. Not for small screens. While the plot pulls from multiple aspects of American history, (such as the slaughter of Natives, waging war in the middle east in search of oil, etc.), the viewer is taken to a place that is completely new and totally breathtaking. Complaints that the story isn't original? Hell, neither was Star Wars. There are no new stories, but there are new ways to tell them, as Avatar does. This is James Cameron's masterpiece.</quote>

  <summary>Set against the backdrop of the chaos and civil war that enveloped 1990s Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond is the story of Danny Archer (DiCaprio), an ex-mercenary from Zimbabwe, and Solomon Vandy (Hounsou), a Mende fisherman. Both men are African, but their histories and their circumstances are as different as any can be until their fates become joined in a common quest to recover a rare pink diamond, the kind of stone that can transform a life... or end it.  (Warner Bros.)</summary>
  <quote>Another great performance by DiCaprio drives this war story about the history of the diamond industry in Sierra Leone.  However, its the performance of Djimon Hounsou as a man trying to regain his family that makes it a film for the heart and mind.</quote>

  <quote>Astonishing debut with unique style and tension that would become Coen Bros. trademarks (later perfected in 'No Country'). Sharp dialogue and tight direction help form a simple yet classic crime tale. It's a slow-burning thriller that focuses on the psychological nature of murder and deceit. Whereas some thrillers have a high body count, this one takes its time to let us experience the pain and paranoia that the characters feel as the result of questionable choices or tragic misunderstandings.</quote>

  <summary>A highly styled 'genre' film which can perhaps be seen as a pastiche of all gangster movies. Tom Reagan is the laconic anti-hero of this amoral tale which is also, paradoxically, a look at morals within the criminal underworld of the 1930s. Two rival gangs vie for control of a city where the police are pawns, and the periodic busts of illicit drinking establishments are no more than a way for one gang to get back at the other. Black humour and shocking violence compete for screen time as we question whether or not Tom, right-hand man of the Irish mob leader, really has a heart. (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>I identify very much with the main character so it's easy for me to love this movie. It's good to see a film about these kinds of teenagers; the ones who show an earnest interest in things like literature and music and strive for a deeper understanding of life. Even if people dismiss this as pretentious or label the kids as overly indie, this is as much a real group of kids as any you'll meet in high school.  Their pain is real, their growth and maturation is real. Also, Ezra Miller is amazing.</quote>

  <summary>The story centers around a family with three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son witnesses the loss of innocence. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A blending of narrative styles that is part &quot;2001&quot; and part &quot;The Fountain,&quot; but not quite as bold as either. It's a beautiful film, no doubt, full of dissected American family dynamics (with focus on the father/son relationship). The synthesis of natural science scenes with a thematic overlay of religious prayer is a unique approach to understanding loss and coming to terms with the fact that all is temporary. The ending is a bit heavy-handed but takes nothing from tremendous acting &amp;amp; direction.</quote>

  <quote>Neil Patrick Harris as a singing, blogging, evil genius?  Entertaining, funny and suprisingly touching at times.  Even the songs are catchy and well performed.  Any fan of Joss Whedon should check this out - and there's really nothing to lose as its only 43 minutes long and available for free online.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoy a musical where the songs feel authentic, woven into the landscape of the film's story rather than jumping out randomly for entertainment purposes. Despite numerous scenes of dancing or celebration, this movie feels organic. Perhaps a few too many plotlines are revealed without total dedication (underdeveloped politics), but the characters are fleshed out. The performance from Topol is simply iconic as well, elevating the film from good to classic.</quote>

  <quote>Film can not hope to reveal every detail or truth about a man's being. The focus of this large-scale recreation of Gandhi's life is to capture the essence of a man who so many people look to as an inspiration and hero. It does a tremendous job at both humanizing and glorifying him &amp;amp; his strict adherence to his transcendent beliefs. While the history is greatly explored, this is not a detailed documentary but a stirring invitation to viewers to discover more about India's journey to Independence.</quote>

  <quote>Brilliant performances from Damon/Williams (beard ftw!) bring to life the energetic and well-written Damon/Affleck script. Real-life friendships of the supporting actors give the film its genuine heart and the dialogue is often as funny as it is thoughtful. It narrowly avoids the pitfalls of traditional uplifting films by being especially observant of the delicate human psyche and juxtaposing the need for love and acceptance vs the need for success and accolades in a very raw and honest manner.</quote>

Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Excellent. I'm learning to appreciate Pixar films in a whole new way now that I have kids, and this one in particular hit all the stirring emotional buttons. I don't see as many nods to adults as some of Pixar's earlier works, but it's an incredible kids film. The only area that could be improved upon was adding a more pressing real life issue that leads to Riley's emotional turmoil, because the script plays it a bit safe. That aside, the world inside Riley's mind is the stuff of movie magic.</quote>

  <quote>A fine movie on all accounts and it doesn't try to be more than a linear character study. It's simple, not particularly artistic, but the viewer truly connects with these organic characters. It goes without saying that the main reason this movie is important is because of the analysis of Black masculinity and homosexuality. It's not a subject found in many movies and the touching final act gives us much needed moments of raw male emotion and vulnerability. An unassuming, but moving film.</quote>

  <quote>A wild musical that's been 'thrown together' perfectly! Visually, a blend of multiple filming styles and thematic stage presentations with spell-binding cinematography. Sonically, the inclusion of dozens of musical genres (with well-performed numbers), combined with convincing and emotional performances from the leads, makes for one of the best early 21st century romantic films. Occasionally over-the-top and strange in scenes that aspire to be Shakespearean, but endlessly endearing and fun.</quote>

Watts' layered acting is impressive, but it's not really even fair to call this a movie; moreso an abstract piece of surreal performance art. Is it a dream? Are these people real? Visually and thematically, it's the younger sister of Lynch's 'Twin Peaks,' complete with odd characters and heavily symbolic red curtains. As in every Lynch production, the music is great and there are interesting visual flairs in each frame.</quote>

  <summary>The absurd antics of an Indiana town's public officials as they pursue sundry projects to make their city a better place.</summary>
  <quote>Although the first season is an obvious attempt to piggy-back on the Office, unique and memorable characters start to shine in seasons 2 and 3. Ron Swanson and Andy Dwyer are the two who make the most of their screen time, though everyone is pretty hilarious. Rob Lowe rekindles his career with a tightly performed role and Leslie and Ben are genuinely sweet - if not occasionally over-the-top. You have to get this kind of off-beat humor to enjoy it, but if you do it's a rewarding experience.</quote>

  <quote>Charming, heart-warming, depressing--this film is all of these things in the space of 80 minutes. 'Life isn't like it is in the movies;' remember that. Or don't! Allow yourself to daydream. Films are the ultimate escape from the mundane. There is much to love about this masterpiece of storytelling that occupies so little time, but in the end it may be analyzing the viewer and our increasing obsession (immersion) with art even more than we realize. Like Tom/Gil, this film is two things at once.</quote>

  <quote>Other than the first 15-20 minutes that quickly introduce the characters to viewers unfamiliar with &quot;Firefly,&quot; it successfully feels like a continuation of the show.  It wraps up the biggest questions viewers have, (namely what River's story is) and concludes the overall arc with a bang.  While this could be viewed as a stand-alone film, the emotional impact of the final half hour will only hit those that have the prior 14 episode history with these characters.  The series never lets you down.</quote>

  <summary>Set in 1964, Doubt centers on a nun who confronts a priest after suspecting him abusing a black student. He denies the charges, and much of the play's quick-fire dialogue tackles themes of religion, morality and authority.</summary>
  <quote>A terrific adaptation of the stage version which doesn't really need to stray far from its theatrical origins. This a performance-driven moral discussion piece, and the performances are all brilliant.</quote>

  <summary>The misadventures of an arrogant, egocentric young Emperor named Kuzco, who is transformed into a llama by his power-hungry advisor -- the devious diva Yzma. Stranded in a jungle, Kuzco's only chance to get back home and reclaim the high life rests with a good-hearted peasant named Pacha. (Walt Disney Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>One of Disney's funniest animated films, by far. The humor is very off-the-wall with quick fire delivery and crisp action that propels well developed characters. This style of comedy would prove to be very influential over the rest of the decade's animation and perhaps even cut a template for rising internet humor (meta jokes, quick-transition shots, etc). This is the best thing David Spade has ever been involved with and the despite the random silliness, there is still a very touching story.</quote>

  <summary>The story of how an eccentric French shop keeper and amateur film maker attempted to locate and befriend Banksy, only to have the artist turn the camera back on its owner with spectacular results. Billed as 'the world's first street art disaster movie' the film contains exclusive footage of Banksy, Shephard Fairey, Invader and many of the world's most infamous graffiti artists at work. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A brilliant commentary on the commercialization of street art (and art in general).  Banksy puts the original focus of this documentary on its head and makes us stand back and say &quot;huh.&quot;  What is art?  Who is an artist?  What does it mean to sell out?</quote>

  <summary>Aspiring comic Rupert Pupkin wants to achieve success in showbiz, by resorting to stalking his idol, a late night talk show host who craves his own privacy.</summary>
  <quote>Perhaps even more relevant now, decades after its release, this is a unique insight into American obsession with celebrity. De Niro is, as Pupkin would say, dynamite. His dual performance as a desperate, yet overly confident stand-up looking to reach the big-time is so akwardly brilliant that you can barely stand to watch it sometimes. The ending manifests in a way that most viewers won't predict, but seems perfectly plausible. In fact, it says more about our culture than Pupkin himself.</quote>

  <quote>Some men will go to astonishing lengths to preserve reputation and retain luxury. This movie had my stomach in knots for over an hour, nearly making me sick from the tension - but that's praise. One heck of a sexy, nihilistic thriller with a plausible premise and dynamite ending. The operatic music is used to tremendous effect, giving these acts of infidelity and depravity an air of high class; fitting as it parallels the monetary comfort of high society against the dangerous power of seduction.</quote>

  <quote>One of the most violent and intensely choreographed action films ever made. Each death is stunningly featured in slow-motion glory and every blood splatter is positioned with a keen eye for style. I can only imagine seeing this before the age of modern video games and being totally blown away. Sadly, having been somewhat de-sensitized by all the imitators and a world where GTA exists, some of the shoot-outs become repetitive. And yet, despite that, it's surprising how well this film has aged.</quote>

  <quote>As the story progresses it distances itself from the comparisons to Battle Royale, etc., and establishes a unique dystopian sci-fi universe. While not delving deeply into the ideologies and motivations of the waring parties (the government is basically just an evil entity), there is enough political intrigue to fascinate mainstream audiences. The action is crisp, the camera work is less distracting than the first film, &amp;amp; the performances are stellar. A terrificly exciting blockbuster sequel.</quote>

  <quote>Early signs of Kubrick's brilliant directing skill. Tightly filmed sequences &amp;amp; thought-provoking dialogue with a compelling overlapping narrative that gives multiple perspectives of the events leading up to the heist. Comments on the power of fate/irony over planning and scheming make for an introspective noir. Not as iconoclastic as future Kubrick, but each quick look into the lives of folks involved in the robbery plot make it much more convincing by giving each character an authentic story.</quote>

It's a slice-of-life homage, it's a collection of scenes, it's a &quot;thank you&quot; to the films, shows &amp;amp; artists that influenced Tarantino. But it's lacking in the story &amp;amp; clever dialogue that has always made his writing shine. I still enjoyed it though. Brilliant acting. Wonderful scenery. The ending saved it for me, plus I think I'll appreciate it more as time goes on, perhaps even just watching parts in more than one sitting.</quote>

Young Hailee Steinfeld is the true star here, outdoing even Bridges and Damon. Overall, slight changes from the original ending do not disappoint, though the flash-forward final scene was unnecessary.</quote>

  <summary>Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other &quot;female&quot; interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I'm hot and cold on Will Ferrell, but I love this movie. It's over-the-top absurd, but owns it. The newsroom cast represents different parts of the male ego (womanizer, crude sports freak, insecure tag-a-long, over-compensator) and though the labels are somewhat shallow, it makes immature jokes forgivable as character flaws in the weaklings of the bunch. The true humor in this film comes from the random, non-vulgar and highly-quotable lines or outbursts from Ferrell and Carrell in particular.</quote>

  <quote>First-time viewers will have a difficult time seeing how fresh and original this film was. Its style has directly impacted independent romantic comedies to this day - i.e. Say Anything or (500) Days of Summer. It's an honest, exposing look at the flaws we have and the many emotions and obstacles that come with revealing ourselves intimately. Though Allen's classic, selfish neurotics are not for everyone, his writing is clever and the film perfectly captures middle-class life in 1970s New York.</quote>

  <quote>Subtle evil and naivety pulse through the veins of the very low-key, very brilliant performances from Sheen and Spacek. Astounding direction, especially in the final 30 minutes featuring the great car chase. One might think while watching this movie that such apparently normal people who behave like this don't really exist, but when considering the pragmatic light Malick casts on them, it makes the fact that this is inspired by a true story all the more disturbing... but easier to comprehend.</quote>

  <quote>A spiritual sequel to films like Full Metal Jacket or Platoon, this is an intense look at what happened to many soldiers coming home from Vietnam, rather than an exposé of the horrors they witnessed. Tom Cruise gives an amazing and thoroughly convincing performance. The symbolic parallels of 1950s America versus the late 1960s are a culture shock (displayed eloquently in the parade sequences). The film has an anti-war message, but doesn't preach endlessly for one side. Kovic is a flawed hero.</quote>

  <quote>Strong performances, good direction. I'm a sucker for gangster dramas and this hits all the right notes with solid characters and a good story. It's sort of a humanizing, neighborhood version of Goodfellas with a dash of morality added to the crime boss. It's not a top-level gangster classic, but it's definitely second-tier and worth a watch for fans of the genre. The heated race relations of the 1960s add to the backdrop, bringing to life a tense environment that transports viewers to the era.</quote>

  <quote>Cruise and Foxx are both amazing in vastly different roles and the direction from Mann makes this an elite thriller. It bleeds style, from the slick photography/editing to an intellectual commmentary that emits from the dialogue like smoke through the keyhole of a hotel room door. The violence is ever-present, but never grotesque; Cruise just seems to know how to look cool when he holds a gun. Only a lackluster ending that departs from the established mood keeps this from being truly remarkable.</quote>

Clooney is great, equally impressive is Woodley as his eldest daughter. They both undergo subtle, yet dynamic growth as they learn their strength as a team. A good mix of comedy and serious situations lead up to a serviceable ending, enhanced by a touching and poignant final shot.</quote>

Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to finish Dumbledore's work and find the rest of the Horcruxes to defeat the Dark Lord. But little hope remains for the Trio, and the rest of the Wizarding World, so everything they do must go as planned. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The most mature of the series and also the most beautifully filmed. Very dark imagery with developed performances by the main players. There's so many details that they can't cover from the books, but I left the theater wishing the movie was still going.  That's never a bad feeling. The films have grown consistently from the beginning (though Azkaban proved to be the standout of the first 4). The action is mostly reserved for part 2, but this chapter takes the franchise to its emotional height.</quote>

  <quote>Some fans criticize the artistic adaptation of the book and a few of Cauron's cinematic concepts, but most realize this was the necessary leap in style and atmosphere that the series needed to make the mature transition from children's fantasy. Oldman is an impeccable choice for Sirius Black and the young trio of stars start to develop as actors here. Quick and enthralling, it's one of the technical high points in the saga and the best film thematically aside from the final two installments.</quote>

  <summary>Steven Spielberg directs an international cast in Munich, a gripping suspense thriller set in the aftermath of the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munch Olympics. This dramatic exploration inspired by true events follows a secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and kill the 11 Palestinians suspected to have planned the Munich attack -- and the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it. (Universal Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>As a companion piece to the intense documentary &quot;One Day in September,&quot; it serves as a brilliant and bloody illustration of the horrors that surrounded the 1972 Munich Olympics. As a modern drama, it still holds a great deal of importance considering the continued violence in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Spielberg and the writers do their best to stay unbiased and tell the history honestly, despite their heritage. Though the ending is erratic, it remains a compelling and thoughtful film.</quote>

Convinced the girl of his dreams is gone forever, he gets a second chance when he spots her in a skyscraper window across the avenue from his office. With only his heart, imagination and a stack of papers to get her attention, his efforts are no match for what the fates have in store for him. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Sickeningly sweet, in the way that Disney has perfected over the years. It's a charming little love story and the animation is a style that I hope Disney returns to in the future. It's a blend of their signature hand-drawn style with a 3D computer graphic flair that grabs hold of the senses. The setting and time period add to the appeal and the music enhances the viewing experience as well. It's a simple little thing that's good for the heart.</quote>

  <quote>Meryl Streep's performance is sheer perfection and Kevin Kline is amazing as well. With lesser actors, 3/4 of this movie could have been uninteresting, but these two simply capture your attention and sympathy. The final act is the strongest, with emotional highs and lows coming quickly and packing significant punches. The film handles the subjects of mental health, depression, and grief quite well and aptly uses Stingo as a neutral control for his live-wire counterparts. Very worthwhile viewing.</quote>

  <quote>Considerable let-down after Empire, but nonetheless, a strong ending to a classic trilogy. The problem is that it can't decide whether to be a serious action film or a campy kid's adventure. There are darker, provocative moments that stand out: i.e. the scenes at Jabba's palace or the final moments on the second Death Star, but then we have almost all the scenes on the moon of Endor which can be painful to watch as an adult. Ultimately, moments with Luke and Vader are sincere and a saving grace.</quote>

  <summary>By tying thousands of balloons to his home, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen sets out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America. Right after lifting off, however, he learns he isn't alone on his journey, since Russell, a wilderness explorer 70 years his junior, has inadvertently become a stowaway on the trip.</summary>
  <quote>Another great Pixar film that would have been a masterpiece had it not been for some of Russell's annoying characteristics and the moment when the film turns dogs into airplane pilots. Generally, the villain and his army of trained pooches felt a little forced. Otherwise, the driving force of the plot (Carl's love for his late wife) is incredibly engaging emotionally and Carl Fredricksen becomes one of Pixar's most memorable creations on his own right. That montage will get you every time.</quote>

  <summary>The youngest son (Hardy) of an alcoholic former boxer (Nolte) returns home, where he's trained by his father for competition in a mixed martial arts tournament -- a path that puts the fighter on a collision corner with his older brother (Edgerton). (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The underdog sports story is older than the Bible and I couldn't care less about MMA. Additionally, the comparisons to last year's 'The Fighter' are unavoidable (brothers, addiction, fighting, etc). Yet somehow, despite all the genre cliches and sentimental predictability, the story of these brothers and their tormented father (an incredible Nolte) captivated me right up to the ending that I already knew was coming. Like 'The Fighter,' it's the strong performances that makes this compelling.</quote>

As Sailor and Lula head out by road across the United States, these ghosts and these forces slowly catch up with them, putting their love to the test, and ultimately placing it in jeopardy.</summary>
  <quote>As expected with Lynch you'll have lots of strong imagery &amp;amp; some weird or disturbing scenes, but overall this plot is surprisingly linear. It's tremendously romantic &amp;amp; sweet, lots of sex mixed with intense splashes of violence. Cage &amp;amp; Dern give convincing caricature performances, Ladd is bonkers &amp;amp; Dafoe is absolutely creeptastic.</quote>

  <quote>An incredible cyberpunk sci-fi universe painted like Blade Runner, with old school detective vibes. The first six episodes are nearly perfect. The big reveal is somewhat disappointing though, with the cerebral atmosphere being abandoned for a more physical tone with (admittedly) well-choreographed fights. The shift knocks it down a few points. Still, a visually impressive -- and depressive -- image of the future.</quote>

  <quote>After last year's scorching &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; won big at the Academy Awards, the Coen brothers decided to dumb down and make an all-out ridiculous comedy.  With a dream cast that included George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand, the pace is blinding and the story about a couple of idiots trying to blackmail a former CIA agent is at times, absurd.  But that's its redeeming quality.  By the end, you'll be ready to throw up your arms in either approval or disgust; and laugh out loud.</quote>

  <summary>A famous film director returns home to a Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years. He reminisces about his childhood at the Cinema Paradiso where Alfredo, the projectionist, first brought about his love of films. He is also reminded of his lost teenage love, Elena, who he had to leave before he left for Rome. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Beautiful images &amp;amp; music propel a frequently moving story about the power of film as human expression. The movie drips with nostalgia and poetic symbolism like wet paint from an artist's brush. The scenes with Alfredo and young Toto are the best and most emotional, but by the time Toto becomes an adult we don't really understand his motivations and it's hard to tell if Alfredo's life lessons have been positive or negative. Perhaps, though, that's an allegorical expression of a childhood lost.</quote>

  <quote>What it lacks in story compared to the HP saga, it more than makes up in style and imagination. Yates is perfectly suited to direct these movies and the setting of 1920s New York really hits the mark.  It's a fun-filled romp that left me satisfied in so many ways.</quote>

  <summary>Four Lions is the tale of four British Islamic jihadists and their bungling plan to detonate a bomb during the London marathon. As things don't go to plan their differing ideological ideals clash and their plans turn to farce. A comedy with tragic overtones about ideologies, terrorism and idiots.</summary>
  <quote>Writer/Director Chris Morris has developed satire over the past two decades and is a comparable British equivalent to Jon Stewart. His film is about 4 bumbling British Islamic jihiadists who are trying to plan the perfect terrorist attack, but struggle with their true reasons for doing so. There are a number of moments of nervous humor drawn from ridiculous bombing techniques (i.e. bombs strapped to crows, silly costumes). A maddening mix of terror, physical comedy and witty dialogue exchanges.</quote>

  <quote>A step up from part 1; a terrific action film with tremendous sets &amp;amp; a quick pace, despite the long run time. Though the Hobbit trilogy will never pack the emotional punch or the terrific story of the LOTR saga, it's still a blast stepping foot into this world. Jackson's direction is always sharp, the battle choreography is inspired and Bilbo shines brightly. This chapter likely contains the most memorable and exciting scenes from the book and Smaug's reveal was breathtaking. Best dragon ever.</quote>

  <summary>Tom Hooper directs this drama based on the true story of Britain's King George VI (Colin Firth), a man who for years struggled with a nervous disposition and an embarrassing stutter -- until he seeks help from unorthodox Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Logue's pioneering treatment and unlikely friendship give the royal leader a sense of confidence that serves him and his country well during the dark days of World War II.</summary>
  <quote>Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are incredible and carry the film on the undeniable power of their Oscar-worthy performances (Rush would be a shoe-in if not for Christian Bale).  Would have liked more back story on Albert's youth and perhaps a little longer ending after the speech to truly reflect upon the dark days that were approaching Europe.  The happier, hopeful ending was appropriate for the main subject of the film, but not necessarily from a historical standpoint. Still, a great biopic.</quote>

He discovers that no matter how amazing or influential the period, people who inhabit it will always dream of another time and place. Paris is gorgeous, Allen's dialogue is sharp as ever.

  <quote>The ultimate in animal awareness!  Raccoon testicles in all their magical might! My wife can't stand this movie because it's so ridiculous and the animals do magic with their male parts. But that's one of the reasons I like it. Seriously, these raccoons shape-shift from realistic looking animals to a bizarre animated warrior clan that's fighting against urban development--and they use their scrotum to get past various obstacles! It's definitely a message film, but a creative (mildly insane) one.</quote>

  <summary>The story of the life and career of the famed baseball player, Lou Gehrig. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Extremely nostalgic; images of American life when baseball was King and Gehrig was the quintessential American hero. It's a heart-warming love story, if not occasionally over-sweet in its presentation, but also crushing to witness Cooper's subtle handling of Gehrig's early symptoms and diagnosis. Released so shortly after Gehrig's death, there's not much information that was available about ALS, but it certainly prompts some investigation for modern viewers. The final scenes always choke me up.</quote>

  <summary>Aussie director John Hillcoat helmed this gripping, epic-scale Western set in the thick of the 1880s outback. When no-nonsense lawman Capt. Stanley (Ray Winstone) apprehends the notorious Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and his younger sibling, Mikey (Richard Wilson), Stanley makes Charlie an unsavory proposition: If he murders his outlaw brother, Arthur (Danny Huston), Mikey will escape the hangman's noose. Emily Watson plays Stanley's genteel wife. </summary>

  <summary>A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind and water. It is cold enough to crack stones, and, when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the warmer south, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there.</summary>
  <quote>Perhaps the most visually arresting imagination of post-Apocalyptic America aside from the Walking Dead. Everything is dark and hopeless, but in such an overwhelming way that it seems real. Viggo Mortensen is terrific, helping the film pack an emotional punch. While the film can never quite reach the poetic level of the Pulitzer Prize winning novel it's based on, there's little that the movie does wrong in adapting the story about the human condition and the will to survive.</quote>

  <quote>Simply a joy to watch. The music and animation are beautiful. The attention to detail is something we've come to expect from Studio Ghibli and there's no shortage of intricately designed scenes here. While it's not quite as bizarrely unique or fantastical as most Miyazaki features, it's a great adaptation of the 'Borrowers' story. The message of bravery in the face of uncertainty is a little rushed, but sincere. Arrietty is a wonderful lead; a good role model for girls approaching adolescence.</quote>

  <quote>It's reputation as a classic led me to some disappointment due to high expectations. It's brilliant in many ways, but it was achingly slow at points too without any real reason. You could easily edit out 30 minutes and have a much tighter and coherent film (the highway scene, some of the quiet meandering around hallways and lakes, etc). There are still strong performances, beautifully shot scenes, and dialogue to spark introspection though, and those make it worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>J.J. Abrams' homage to Spielberg. The setting and band of youths are right out of a classic 80s film like Stand By Me or The Goonies, yet each character is unique and memorable. This is the perfect summer movie - an amazing balance of fun and fright; action, humor and heart. Though the back-story should have been developed a little further and the ending is a tad rushed and predictable, the strength lies with the fantastic and inspired performances from the the best ensemble kids cast in years.</quote>

  <quote>Profoundly unsettling, often coming off as a realistic psychological horror. Swinton is amazing and both Newell and Miller are disturbing in their respective portrayals of the deeply troubled Kevin. As a viewer you want the parents to get him professional help early on, rather than struggle privately, but the film makes it clear that Kevin is a manipulative and calculating individual. The film shows enough to disturb without getting graphic, but leaves many questions about Kevin's psychopathy.</quote>

  <quote>It's one of those classics that almost everyone has seen, but with good reason. The style and look may be dated, but the relationships and high school personalities are just as real today as they were in the 80s. Once the awkward phase is over, the charisma and emotion drive home iconic scenes and memorable quotes. Folks often criticize John Hughes films for being schmaltzy, but they never fail to make us feel something genuine.</quote>

  <quote>A frank introduction to Jim Crow and the falsehoods of 'separate but equal;' filmmakers assume that the audience has some knowledge of American Civil Rights. The film doesn't go much deeper than the personal relationships of the main cast, but in this case it's a strength. Some caricature issues exist and the writers forget that sometimes evil can be more harmful in subtle character attacks, rather than in upfront racism. Still, it's full of heartbreaking moments with tremendous emotional value.</quote>

  <summary>A new technologically-superior Soviet nuclear sub, the Red October, is heading for the U.S. coast under the command of Captain Marko Ramius (Connery). The American government thinks Ramius is planning to attack. A lone CIA analyst (Baldwin) has a different idea: he thinks Ramius is planning to defect, but he has only a few hours to find him and prove it-because the entire Russian naval and air commands are trying to find him, too.

  <quote>Reveals to the audience that same-sex relationships struggle with the same issues as traditional ones - maybe even to heightened degrees at points because of feelings of inadequacy based on socially perceived gender roles. It's also a critique of a &quot;grass is always greener&quot; outlook, as the kids' search for the ideal father figure complicates the delicate family balance. Character flaws are heightened by the story arc, but are terrific foils for the emotional struggles faced by American families.</quote>

  <quote>Brad Bird is a fan of classics, that is obvious. All his previous works, just like MI4, are homages to what make the masterworks of the genre so memorable. The script does nothing new and is full of spy-movie cliches (right up to the naughty Russian), but it uses them pitch-perfectly. The Dubai scenes are astounding, especially the tower-climb. It's not as smart as Bourne or as sexy as Bond, but packs the explosive action, techno-gadgets, stunts and tense moments needed in an effective thriller.</quote>

  <quote>Visually breathtaking with painted backdrops &amp;amp; interesting lighting techniques. A majority of the film is essentially blocked as a stage play with bleak musical narration. It's plot is thin, though the final act is tremendous and emotionally devastating (especially if you have a close relationship with your mother). Allegorically, it's a dissection of the Japanese culture's differing generational views on respecting elders, represented by members of the film's central family &amp;amp; their actions.</quote>

  <summary>Daryl Davis is an accomplished musician who was played all over the world. He also has an unusual hobby, particularly for a middle aged black man. When not displaying his musical chops, Daryl likes to meet and befriend members of the Ku Klux Klan. When many of these people eventually leave the Klan with Daryl's support, Daryl keeps their robes and hoods; building his collection piece by piece, story by story, person by person, in hopes of one day opening a museum of the Klan.</summary>
  <quote>An incredibly interesting story. Daryl is clearly a great human being doing what he can to help combat racism on a person-to-person level; his interactions with members of the Klan are surreal to say the least. I like that the filmmakers included a segment of criticism of Daryl's tactics, suggesting he could have been doing more to combat institutional racism. The final scene taking place after the credits to include the 2016 election results was well done, and leaves this open for discussion.</quote>

  <quote>Nobody masters the animated emotional-tug like Pixar. Complaints about the story are valid as it borrows much from previous fairy tales, but credit is due to the creators for presenting strong female characters who control each scene they step into. Furthermore, there are none of the trappings of an obligatory romantic interest for Merida, which is quite refreshing. Fast paced action and comedy propel our heroines through this adventure and the animation is remarkable; redhead-lovers rejoice!</quote>

  <summary>Truman Capote (Hoffman), during his research for his book In Cold Blood, an account of the murder of a Kansas family, the writer develops a close relationship with Perry Smith, one of the killers. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Though slowly paced at times, the narrative effectively showcases Capote's interview and writing process while revealing his strengths and character flaws. PSH is simply marvelous, capturing Truman at his very essence. Truly, his performance is the main draw of the film, though Capote's relationship with Harper Lee was interesting as well. Recommended for fans of post-war American literature and journalism, it also serves as a unique companion to the book that inspired the film's story.</quote>

  <quote>Though some magic may be lost on first-time viewers, this comedy classic is as innovative and entertaining as anything from the 80s. The cohesive chemistry of the ensemble cast is inspired &amp;amp; the special effects aren't as dated as one may expect. The creature design is unique and the blend of sci-fi &amp;amp; humor has rarely been done so well. It's iconic and spawned a number of spin-offs and loads of merchandise, but the most important thing may be the way it made science and engineering look so cool.</quote>

It's a hard movie to sit back &amp;amp; enjoy, and aside from SLJ's Major Warren, there's nobody to really root for. Overuse of the &quot;n-word&quot; lessens the script a bit for me. The pacing is fine though and the last act really is terrific; Tarantino typically gets endings right.</quote>

The soundtrack is soaring and wonderous, to be sure. However, most of the supporting characters were lacking and the revenge story is a bit uninspired and occasionally cliche. Despite these flaws, this is still one of Dreamworks best animated films and the ending provided for something more real and emotionally moving than initially expected.</quote>

  <quote>Gosling and Stone are not the most physically talented leads for a musical, but they do have incredible comedic and dramatic chemistry. The music is fair, not brilliant. It's a beautiful film, wonderfully made, but not wholly original or unforgettable for any particular reason. Stone's performance is the strongest bit; she masterfully displays a wide range of emotions. Overall, it's a fun movie, but then it tries to take a serious turn that feels forced. Kept me from truly loving it.</quote>

  <quote>Just when I thought I had the ending figured out, it threw a curve ball.  I loved the final montage and the lesson of hard work &amp;amp; determination in order to reach your goals. In an age of instant gratifaction and entitlement, it's a great message for kids and young adults. Even though the characters are fantastical, the themes are realistic. No, not everyone is going to excell, not everyone has been born with certain gifts, but we can all serve a greater purpose by focusing on personal strengths.</quote>

  <quote>Exceptional 1st and final acts, decent middle. But wow, that finale sure is a technological wonder. The animation is amazing throughout, the humor is pretty sharp, and the story (though in need of a few tweaks) delivers in the end. Topics like bullying and embracing individuality are moral highlights and it encourages kids to solve problems with their brain rather than brawn. Some scenes may be a bit frightening for younger viewers, but it's a quality Halloween-time film for the entire family.</quote>

  <quote>The best hand drawn Disney since the Lion King and near to Pixar quality. Emotionally engaging characters &amp;amp; excellent voice acting. The music could have been a little better, but thankfully Randy Newman didn't actually perform the songs. There is some childish humor; forgivable though considering the target audience. Dr. Facilier is the coolest villain since Jafar and though the two main characters spend a little too much time as frogs, their motivations and intentions develop with rich honesty.</quote>

  <summary>This film tells the real-life story of U.S. fighter pilot Dieter Dengler, a German-American shot down and captured in Laos during the Vietnam War. Dengler, to be played by Bale, organized a death-defying escape for a small band of POWs, including Duane Martin (Zahn). (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>This is a folk legend re-telling of Herzog's documentary on the life of U.S. fighter-pilot Dieter Dengler, who escaped capture during the Vietnam War. There are a few creative liberties taken with the script, but they make for an incredibly tense and harrowing odyssey through the jungles of Laos. The landscape is beautiful, yet terrifying. Our weary heroes, Bale and Zahn, both invested themselves physically and mentally for challenging roles. An incredible story of the human will to survive.</quote>

  <quote>A romantic epic for the ages, which receives an equal amount of praise/hatred for the melodramatic story of Jack and Rose. Kate/Leo have given better performances, but still draw us in. Additionally, in the hands of masterful director James Cameron, there's more than enough sincere emotional content to pay respect to the tragic event and a special-effects showcase to satisfy the skeptics. Once the ship hits the iceberg and starts taking water, this is a technological juggernaut with few peers.</quote>

  <summary>After a zombie becomes involved with the girlfriend of one of his victims, their romance sets in motion a sequence of events that might transform the entire lifeless world. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Could Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet get any more emo?! The zombie genre is over-saturated right now and this little number could have been lost in the leg-dragging shuffle if it went the polished melodrama route. Instead, thanks to a capable leading couple and a few creative liberties with undead lore, it makes charming twists on the horror genre. A bit like the Unforgiven-light of it's ilk, it suggests (lovingly) that zombies are becoming obsolete. Genuine heart, good acting and great music are highlights.</quote>

  <summary>In this exciting prequel to the X-Men series, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) -- the future Professor X and Magneto -- are best friends dedicated to harnessing their powers and promoting the education of fellow mutants during the turbulent 1960s. The duo works together to stop a powerful adversary that threatens mankind, but their ideological differences drive them apart and turn them into ferocious enemies.</summary>
  <quote>Edges out X2 as the best film in the X-Men series and is nearly as entertaining as the 1st Iron Man. McAvoy and Fassbender are incredible as Professor X and Magneto, providing deep emotional substance not often found in summer blockbusters. Sadly, supporting characters like Angel and Banshee are laughable and distract from otherwise fantastically directed action. It is disappointing that a terrific story is stuck with some uninteresting mutants, but still, the awesome far outweighs the ugly.</quote>

  <quote>The blocking and cinematography are great, the performances are flawless, but I just didn't connect with the characters here. Maybe it's because most of the historical conflict is only delivered through monologues, or that I've been desensitized to far more disturbing or troubling stories of parent-child relationships. A perfectly made film with just a tad missing to truly reach me emotionally.</quote>

  <summary>Tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who starts aging backwards with bizarre consequences. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A beautifully constructed film about the life of a man who ages backwards.  The real star is the cinematography and computer graphics used on the characters played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.  To see both actors looking physically like they did 10 to 15 years ago was simply incredible.  The story is strong and the acting is solid as well, but the movie borrows too much from its older sibling, &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; (same screenwriter, Eric Roth) to have earned all the acclaim it has received.</quote>

  <quote>A fitting conclusion to an epic saga, though Nolan's grandiose ambition causes a rushed final act featuring deus ex machina moments that detract from an otherwise excellent script. Thematically, it's another dynamite experience. The cast is stellar, JGL in particular is a terrific addition. Also, Bane is the perfect villain to follow the Joker as he tests the Wayne/Batman duality physically after his psychological break. Bale squeezes every emotion out of his character in a bittersweet farewell.</quote>

  <quote>DeMille really knew how to make 'em. I thought this was no earlier than the 40s due to it's large scale and impressive photography. It's a folktale retelling of the months following the Civil War and the subsequent battles with Natives as the United States moved west. Inspired by true events, they're woven together to make a more dramatic, cohesive narrative. Some of the Indian segments are stereotypical, but the film excels overall. Cooper and Arthur in particular are really great together.</quote>

  <summary>It takes a wide screen to fully capture Homer Simpson's stupidity, and The Simpsons Movie does it.  In the eagerly-awaited animated feature film based on the hit TV series, Homer must save the world from a catastrophe he himself created.  (20th Century Fox)</summary>
  <quote>I don't know exactly what people expected when they went to see this. Some people complained that it was &quot;just a long episode of the Simpsons.&quot; Well, the episodes always have beginning and ending plot points, so what's the big fuss? Even if that were the case, I thought the film touched on character subjects the series hasn't. You might actually question whether or not Marge is still willing to put up with Homer after all these years, or if Bart really is such a badass.</quote>

  <summary>After three years of fighting in the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker concludes his journey towards the Dark Side of the Force, putting his friendship with Obi Wan Kenobi and his marriage at risk.</summary>
  <quote>The meat and potatoes of the prequel trilogy and, thankfully, somewhat of a return to the quality that fans expected. Seems like Lucas should have focused more on the dark aspects of these films as the atmosphere here is similar to 'Empire.' Still, obvious room for improvement in dialogue and Hayden acts like a baby instead of the badass that Vader is supposed to be. Thankfully Ewan McGregor performs admirably and reaches out to the audience with the only honest emotional prequel performance.</quote>

  <summary>As he plans his next job, a longtime thief tries to balance his feelings for a bank manager connected to one of his earlier heists, as well as the FBI agent looking to bring him and his crew down.</summary>
  <quote>Affleck has come into his own as a director, with obvious influence from Scorsese.  While the love story feels a bit forced, it doesn't distract too much from a great heist film. Affleck's character is the &quot;criminal with a conscience,&quot; a tragic hero who is struggling with making a change in his ways. The camera-work, car chases and shoot-outs rival 'Heat' for some of the best I've seen in a crime drama. Though the ending could be called a little too &quot;neat&quot; by some, I personally felt satisfied.</quote>

  <quote>The chemistry of Tudyk and Labine makes for a number of laugh-out-loud moments, as well as a few that are genuinely heartfelt. It's a buddy movie wrapped inside a loving satire of slasher flicks. There's so many ridiculous moments and tragically comic misunderstandings that you can't help but roll your eyes and chuckle. 'These college kids just started killing themselves all over our property!' I'm not a fan of horror movies, but the humor made up for my disinterest in the gore and violence.</quote>

  <quote>Great chemistry and terrific acting from the main 4 players.  The military angle is very appropriate for the first decade in post WWII America - and still rings true today in an economic sense.  It's sentimental without being corny. Some of the songs, (memorable as they are), and dance numbers go on a little longer than they need to, but they don't knock the film down enough to keep it from being a classic.</quote>

  <summary>Based on the real life story of canyoneer Aron Ralston, who in 2003 was forced to self-amputate his arm after being stranded and pinned underneath a boulder inside of Bluejohn's Canyon in Utah.</summary>
  <quote>A good film that succeeds on the back of Franco's strong performance, but lacks some focus in the flashback and hallucination scenes. Boyle's style is evident - alot of Slumdog style camera work and sound, which help elevate the film to a level of art that an episode of &quot;I Shouldn't Be Alive&quot; is unable to achieve. The viewer is drawn in and the climax is filmed to magnificent effect. A lesser of the Best Picture noms, but a worthy story of perseverance and a great exercise in art direction.</quote>

  <quote>Ranks with Raimi's SM2 as the best film adaptation of Spider-Man. Obviously it feels like we've seen segments of this movie before (we have), but it's like a fine restoration. We see things a bit clearer and there's added back story. Also, Garfield is more interesting as Peter despite occasional moments (script issues) where awkwardness feels a little forced. Plot wise, Connors is a tragic villain. The complex humanity in supporting characters like him and Gwen makes this a successful reboot.</quote>

  <quote>I honestly don't know why people hate on this show so badly. Because their precious &quot;nerd&quot; culture has been popularized?  I'd rather see a popular comedy show that references sci-fi and fantasy stuff than something that relies solely on physical comedy and fart jokes. This does contain some low-brow jokes on occasion, but the blending of topical situations with modern pop culture is a recipe for success. The down side is, characters become parodies of themselves the longer the show goes on.</quote>

  <summary>The life of 11-year old Billy Elliot (Bell), a coal miner&amp;amp;#039;s son in Northern England, is forever changed one day when he stumbles upon a ballet class during his weekly boxing lesson.  (Universal Focus)</summary>
  <quote>A moving story of a coal mining community faced with hard times during a worker's strike.  The focus is on one family's individual struggles.  Father and eldest son are out of work, striking for higher wages and the youngest son is doing his best to take care of his declining grandmother and hide his love of dance from those who don't think ballet is for boys.  The music is great and the film stresses that you don't have to be gay to enjoy dancing; but if someone does happen to be gay, its ok.</quote>

  <quote>Technologically amazing, terrifically acted and the presentation is flawless. So why don't I feel more? For a majority of the film I found myself wondering where Birdman was headed, where our aging hero was going to land. I admire many of the industry criticisms and in-jokes, but I was disappointed at a lack of conclusion to the story. Still, this film is an important landmark in filmmaking because of the style alone. It's a unique vision that will be hard to recreate.</quote>

  <summary>Birth is a miracle, a rite of passage, a natural part of life. But birth is also big business. Compelled to explore the subject after the delivery of her first child, actress Ricki Lake recruits filmmaker Abby Epstein to question the way American women have babies... (Red Envelope Entertainment)</summary>
  <quote>Gets the point across pretty well, but manages to stay unbiased by including a surprisingly emotional and personal ending. It was shocking to see how quickly hospital birth became the norm in America and how doctors rushed mothers towards c-section deliveries. Sadly, due to a lot of the supporters of home birth and 'women's choice' being hippies or free-thinkers, it might not change the mind of people who think home births are &quot;for ultra-feminists&quot; or those who simply oppose the medical system.</quote>

  <quote>Campy fun. Not nearly as 'impressive' as most of Tarantino's other works, but the chase scenes are both intense and incredibly filmed. I didn't mind the dialogue (seems to be a main gripe) and enjoyed the classic exploitation devices. The film is exactly what I anticipated based on the trailer; Russell is great as a villain and most of the ladies put on their best seduction show. Admittedly, dialogue scenes do cut some of the tension of the car chases, but those willing will find a happy medium.</quote>

  <quote>Like the inbred, redneck cousin of Jarmusch's 'Stranger than Paradise,' there's not much in way of plot or goals for the main characters. It's a home movie of the America that God forgot, with the viewer as an active participant. There are few characters with redeeming qualities and I'm not always sure what Korine is trying to say, but I do know that this film puts an ugly truth on display that many in the 'developed world' would sooner pretend doesn't exist. Tender, disturbing, weird. Honest.</quote>

A tad less CGI and more character development would benefit the heart of script, but the viewer can take solice in the fact this is merely one part of a whole and a grand intro to the LOTR mythology.</quote>

  <summary>This ultimate romantic comedy weaves together a spectacular number of love affairs into one amazing story.  (Universal Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>This is a refreshing holiday film, full of humor and charm. The cast is terrific and Bill Nighy is especially engaging as the aging rock star. There's lots of love, lots of whimsy, plenty of romantic moments of fantastical proportions... but then there's also realism, disappointment and heartbreak. It covers all the bases and despite a few cliches here or there, it handles them with grace. Interesting how the film lampoons American sexuality, however, still bitter over the Revolution?</quote>

The story is fine, but merely serves to move us along to an unexceptional climax. I felt more impressed by the dialogue, direction &amp;amp; music, which definitely makes for an unforgettable viewing experience. Hitchcock has several better scripts and thrilling mysteries to his credit, but very few had such lush and ornate packaging.</quote>

  <quote>The dialogue, style and bombastic soundtrack make this standout from similar adventures within the invasion genre. The acting is solid. London street language is interesting from an American perspective;  it's almost like a hip-hop variation of A Clockwork Orange. At just over 80 minutes, it's a quick burst of exciting action that lacks a little focus and development, but is full of interesting characters. The creature design and atmosphere is memorable: 'too black to see' is a chilling thought.</quote>

  <summary>When a corrupt businessman and the grotesque Penguin plot to take control of Gotham City, only Batman can stop them, while the Catwoman has her own agenda.</summary>
  <quote>Incomparable to Nolan's films. In 1992, this was the coolest thing around. The non-stop action, penguins with rockets, the merchandise (Batmobile ftw)... Burton's incarnations of Batman may have cheese and over-the-top villains, but they feel like comic books movies. Pfeiffer creates the definitive Catwoman with a smoldering performance and DeVito gets as much possible out of the Penguin. Add Elfman's iconic soundtrack and enjoy the dark and absurd carnival ride through Burton's Gothic visuals.</quote>

  <quote>Very good, but a tiny something is missing.  I think it was the latter part of Allen &amp;amp; Farrow's misadventure and escape from the hitmen that left me a little indifferent. The ending of the film, however, with the Thanksgiving of struggling artists and their faithful manager, was a beautiful moment with dialogue that left a warm feeling. This is not one of Woody's greatest achievements, and feels more like a nice way to spend an evening rather than a typical Allen analysis of the human condition.</quote>

  <quote>A teen comedy that is totally self-aware, with an authentic soul and surprising insight towards adolescence. Character types, clothing styles, music choices and well-crafted dialogue represent a cross-section of 90s pop culture. Paul Rudd and Brittany Murphy are highlights here, showcasing natural cool and absolute charm which showed the mainstream that grunge had substance. Though it would spawn a number of imitators over the next decade, none had the heart or development of this trend-setter.</quote>

  <quote>A lesser Scorsese picture, but one that still holds his signature direction and camera work. The premise isn't incredibly interesting, but the smokey pool hall scenes and terrific framing of shots gives it a sense of cool that keeps things from feeling dated. Newman gives a subtle, yet emotional performance that counters the live-wire Cruise. The dialogue doesn't quite live up to 'The Hustler,' but despite the small flaws it's still a fitting send-off for classic character Fast Eddie Felson.</quote>

  <quote>An intimate look at celebrity through a man who seems to rely on human attention and affection in order to survive. His devotion to performance is exhausting.

He can be a jerk to his staff, but only in the moments where he is free to drop the performance act.</quote>

The sheer number of jokes guarantees a few chuckles, but a majority go for the low-hanging fruit and you can see the punchline coming from a mile away. The action is good, but the very nature of the movie removes a lot of suspense and consequence.</quote>

  <quote>Have you ever seen a movie and sort-of loved it, but never felt the need to see it again? That's how I am with this. It's got hilarious parts, incredible action, and terrific visuals... But it's also a tad too immature for its own good and has little lasting reward. The violence is stylish, to be sure, but it's also a bit exploitative and over-stimulating. I was both impressed and disgusted by certain scenes and found myself wanting more class and manners.</quote>

  <summary>Just before Christmas, Lee Leander is caught shoplifting. It is her third offense. She is prosecuted by John Sargent. He gets the trial postponed because it is hard to get a conviction at Christmastime. But he feels sorry for her and arranges for her bail, and ends up taking her home to his mother for Christmas. Surrounded by a loving family (in stark contrast to Lee&amp;amp;#039;s own family background) they fall in love. This creates a new problem: how do they handle the upcoming trial? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Aside from the painful (but period appropriate) racism and stereotypes that pop up in the first 1/3 of the film, this is a fine addition to the Holiday viewing dossier.  MacMurray and Stanwyck always have tremendous chemistry and the arch of their relationship is believable. After having so much done for her throughout the film, it was great to see Lee put herself on the line for John when it is least expected. Great script and terrific acting.</quote>

  <quote>The acting is fantastic, but the film is frustrating in many ways. I suppose that's on purpose, trying to convey a sense of chaos that the main characters experience. Many who do not suffer from mental illness may not understand decisions characters make - I personally found some behaviors overwhelming - but from what I've heard, it accurately captures some aspects of bipolar disorder with mood swings. The final act is a bit more conventional than the set up, but overall it's a good movie.</quote>

  <quote>Looks great, sounds great, but I'm disappointed with the script. Too many retreads and too much fan service. It's almost as if the characters realize they exist inside a Star Wars movie because it's so self-referencing. Also, similar plot points make it feel like a reboot rather than a continuation. Fun, but not brilliant. That said, it does bring back a stylistic cinematic quality that fits Star Wars perfectly and sets the stage for dynamite sequels as long as writers get appropriately bold.</quote>

  <quote>Rated high for nostalgia, like many others here. Most 80s kids will consider this part of their childhood. It's got cute animals, nice scenery and a heart-warming story. Narration is a bit wacky, but amusing. Of course, there's no computer animation to make the animals look like they're actually speaking as humans would - but like Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, its alot of fun and very charming despite (or maybe because of) the need of a little imagination on the part of the viewer.</quote>

  <quote>Not at all a typical romantic comedy, though many of Benny's scenes lack remarkable note in their originality.  The main draw is the off-beat characters and the fact that Johnny Depp and Mary Masterson share a love that is more unique and genuine than most &quot;higher profile&quot; rom-coms ever accomplish.  Depp's character is extremely likeable and there are a handful of memorable lines.</quote>

  <summary>The Brother is an alien who has crash-landed on Earth, in New York City. While mute, strongly empathic, and able to fix things, he resembles a Black man with strange feet. His attempt to make a place for himself in Harlem is an allegory for the immigrant experience in the United States. Meanwhile, two bounty hunters from the Brother's home planet arrive and try to capture him. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Tenderhearted moments mixed with a dash of race-relation commentary make for an oddly packaged 80s action-comedy. The takeaway is Joe Morton's silent, but powerful, portrayal of alien 'Brother' which continues to be an allegory for immigration issues for a new generation. There are some weird moments involving the bounty hunters that date this, but The Brother's work to find the source of deadly street drugs gives the story a meaningful social duality beneath the surface of a wacky sci-fi flick.</quote>

  <quote>Great soundtrack from Armstrong and Ellington, delightful performances and a decent love story. There's a few stereotypes, as expected in a film from this era, but they weren't nearly as bad as I anticipated. The battle for Little Joe's soul between Heaven's angels and Lucifer Jr.'s gang was nicely done and entertaining. The song &amp;amp; dance numbers were well choreographed and full of energy. Definitely recommended to fans of jazz and musicals, keeping in mind the time period this was a product of.</quote>

  <quote>A bizarre &amp;amp; disjointed Roman &quot;Odyssey&quot; full of erotic or otherwise obscene exploits. It can be viewed as commentary paralleling and lampooning 1960s culture, as there's not much of a story to follow. These oddly interweaving plots are filmed with painstaking care to create beautiful scenery. The scope of the film is tremendous and the sets are fantastic. The wild makeup &amp;amp; costume design also accentuate the beautiful (or sometimes grotesque) bodies that writhe and gyrate in this hedonistic world.</quote>

  <summary>The incredible true story of one of the world's most fascinating leaders -- Tibet's Dali Lama and his daring struggle to rule a nation at one of the most challenging times in its history.</summary>
  <quote>Like 1982's 'Gandhi,' it's an introduction to the history, not a thorough exploration. It's a visual poem full of gorgeous imagery and fascinating scenes about the Tibetan culture. The young monk's education and rise to leadership is compelling, yet it seems like an unfinished film as we see nothing of his adult life or his spiritual &amp;amp; political efforts to preserve the Tibetan identity. A few minutes of epilogue on his life since exile would give a feeling of closure to a beautifully made movie.</quote>

  <quote>Fans of Wolverine specifically will be pleased by the brutal, bleak experience. Jackman and Stewart are fantastic, newcomer Keen impresses, and the vision of a dystopian near-future feels frighteningly real. Issues of immigration and genetic experimentation are right out of today's news, and the X/Logan relationship takes us through an emotional bender. Weak villains, excessive violence, and a flawed final act keep it from being a total masterpiece, but it's still a dynamite experience.</quote>

  <quote>I had the ending spoiled for me before I saw the film, but I still enjoyed it. Some of the effects are weak and the monsters can come across as a little cheesy - but this is more of a social commentary and psychological/suspense thriller rather than a jump-out-of-your-seat horror flick. The performances are raw, emotional and believable. If you haven't already heard how this ends and are looking for a tense movie that isn't afraid to kick you in the gut when you're down, check it out.</quote>

  <quote>Obvious stylistic influence from Kubrick and Lynch, but without as much philosophical depth. Still, I would eagerly watch mundane filler scenes shot with Refn's keen eye for cinematography as he's able to squeeze interesting visual flair out of every frame. The use of color is brilliant and, on occasion, disturbingly beautiful. Gosling doesn't have to do much, but his minor ticks and occasional outbursts display his inner turmoil. Though the substance isn't immediate, there is some to chew on.</quote>

  <quote>I will start off by saying that for me, how &quot;scary&quot; it was has been over-stated and exaggerated. It was much &quot;creepier&quot; than scary. But I will note that I have a pretty strong personal connection with some of the events that took place in the film and that I greatly appreciated the realism. There are a few scenes that will stay with me for a long time, though the very ending added some unwanted cheese.  It's gonna have me thinking for a while, but not necessarily giving me nightmares.</quote>

  <summary>The duck's eggs hatched: but the fifth hatchling, a bit late, isn't like the rest, and momma duck chews poppa out. On top of it all, where the ducklings quack, the oddball honks. He's soon ostracized by all the ducks. He also explores a nest of sparrows and a duck decoy, but there's no acceptance there, either (the decoy bonks him on the head like one of those drinking birds). But just when he's feeling worst, a family of swans comes by, and he's got a new family. (imdb)</summary>

  <summary>Patrick Bateman, a young, well to do man working on wall street at his father's company kills for no reason at all. As his life progresses his hatred for the world becomes more and more intense. Based on the book by Bret Easton Ellis. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's a heavy-handed satire full of over-the-top violence. While this type of in-your-face exploitation is not usually my cup of tea, Christian Bale's performance is absolutely ridiculous and makes it essential viewing for the genre. His rapid-fire rampage through the spectrum of human emotions helps create one of the strangest, most memorable characters in modern cinema. Bateman's monologues and ending murder spree have become the stuff of dark-comedy legend.</quote>

  <quote>A solid outcome after mostly lackluster introductory movies (save for 'Iron Man'). The script is decent, though it relies more on humorous dialogue than an enticing story. Whedon is smart to make RDJ's Tony Stark the centerpiece and while this reduces some others to stereotyped bit parts, Ruffalo breathes much-needed life into the Hulk character. Action in the final battle is a bit overwhelming, but the visual presentation is sharp and discernible. A frenzied, yet entertaining, theme park ride.</quote>

  <quote>This is close to being great, but a few of the casting choices are overly distracting and the last 1/3 seems rushed. This story would have been better served presented as a TV mini-series. Essentially skipping over the 70s was jarring and leaves many more questions unanswered. Whitaker and Oyelowo are both fantastic though.</quote>

  <summary>Based on legendary science-fiction author Philip K. Dick's own experiences, A Scanner Darkly tells the darkly comedic, caustic, but deeply tragic tale of drug use in the modern world.  The film plays like a graphic novel come to life with live-action photography overlaid with an advanced animation process -- a method known as interpolated rotoscoping, first employed in writer/director Richard Linklater's 2001 film &quot;Waking Life&quot; -- to create a haunting version of America, seven years from now.

Although Al has learned a lot, he cannot stop all of them, and Ed cannot use Alchemy while in the other side... (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>This is trashy and immature, especially by Coen. Bros standards, but I still found it hilarious at times. Tom Hanks is incredible as the smooth-talking, sweetly-Southern professor. Even though his character is so odd and out of place for the time period, his performance is one that I'll never forget. Marlon Wayans is loud and boisterous, as he normally is, but the scenes that pair his obscenity-laced outbursts with Hanks' calm and well-spoken responses are classic, despite their obvious nature.</quote>

  <summary>An all-star cast brings to life the true story of Billy Beane, a former jock turned general manager who uses unconventional methods to bring the best players to the Oakland A's, a major league baseball team struggling against financial hardship.</summary>
  <quote>Pitt is engaging in a film otherwise made strictly for baseball geeks. There is truth and importance in the influential Bill James methods that Beane and the A's adopted, but the film fails to recognize key aspects of the team's success like dominant pitching or core stars. Still, the sharp narration and drama put a magnifying glass over the complicated inner-workings of MLB teams and examines the politics of markets and personnel battles. Good the first time, but doesn't merit repeat viewings.</quote>

  <quote>Shane rides into town as a man who has seen these conflicts before. He knows that trouble is everywhere, no matter how long you try to hide from it. Still, he tries to go straight. It's a lesser classic thanks to the story, but the acting style shows its age. The boy particularly; modern child actors are just more natural. Ladd's performance is strong though, holding a certain subtle unease that hints to troubles beneath the surface until the final scene at the bar lets loose his dark past.</quote>

As a technological twist on 'Treasure Island' it can appeal to fans of pirate stories, sci-fi, and even steam punk. The voice work is inspired &amp;amp; gives unique personality to all the main players in an exciting and emotional adventure tale. Disney took a gamble on this and it didn't perform well at the box office, but it has rightly developed a sizable cult following in the past decade.</quote>

  <summary>A film exactly described by its title. German film director Herzog had made a bet with fledgling director Errol Morris that, if Morris made a film, Herzog would eat his shoe. Morris went on to film &amp;amp;#039;Gates of Heaven&amp;amp;#039;, so Herzog kept his promise. While eating the boiled shoe, Herzog carries on a dialogue with the film premier audience on film, art, and life. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>He eats some shoe &amp;amp; shares some knowledge.  His thoughts on the nature of talk shows is a bit of a premonition towards reality television...</quote>

  <summary>British retirees travel to India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Though in ways it's predictably British (in terms of dialogue and wit), it's a touching romp through India with some very relatable characters. Each experiences a situation or emotion with which viewers can empathize. The theme explored is the idea that it's never too late to change or experience new things. Life is always evolving and new opportunities abound. The big complaint is that there's not enough time to get to know each character very well and each story arc is a tad underdeveloped.</quote>

  <quote>While the story leaves something to be desired, the duality of Mortensen's performance is impressive. His family thrust into immediate danger, he transforms from a humble small town diner owner into something entirely different. We find ourselves questioning his true nature well into the middle of the film, and the suspense is handled well. Things unravel a bit in the final act, with an underdeveloped back story and unnecessary characters, but the last five minutes present provocative questions.</quote>

  <summary>Author P. L. Travers reflects on her difficult childhood while meeting with filmmaker Walt Disney during production for the adaptation of her eponymous novel. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Great performances propel us along a road we've already traveled, but engage us enough to still want to see where we're headed. It was fun watching the song/scriptwriters working on the film. Flashbacks were decent (Farrell does surprisingly well), though too frequent. Ultimately, it's a Disney movie boasting about the magic of Disney movies (which can induce some heavy sighing or eye-rolling), but they've got the chops to back it up. Definitely recommended, especially to fans of Mary Poppins.</quote>

  <summary>In Woody Allen's new contemporary comedy, an American journalism student visiting friends in London happens upon the scoop of a lifetime. Along the investigative trail, she finds magic, murder, mystery - and perhaps love, with a British aristocrat.</summary>
  <quote>A comedic mystery with a pretty simple story, but consistently funny dialogue. It's certainly worth a watch for Allen fans and though it's not on the level he is capable of, even a lesser Allen script has its rewards. One small issue is that Johannsen is basically playing a younger, female version of Woody, which makes her chemistry with Jackman's character somewhat unbelievable. The theatrical narrative style is appealing though, creating some thoughtful questions about the afterlife.</quote>

  <quote>OK, so this is only funny if you're a big fan of sci-fi (Star Wars in particular) or Mel Brooks, but when the jokes hit, they hit well.  It's undeniably corny, immature, and sometimes the jokes are way too obvious.  But hey, Mel sells it so well that it's forgivable.  John Candy and Rick Moranis are highlights and there are plenty of memorable gags that make this worth a view.</quote>

  <quote>I know it's not especially good, I know there's a lot of male fantasy issues (lots of cleavage, ass shots &amp;amp; girls falling over the main character), but the show corrects some of those issues as it goes along. It's inconsistent with some odd story arcs, but the good bits are actually very good. The art is wonderful, the music is great, and the action sequences are sensational. It's a light fantasy anime, but sometimes that can be fun. Plus Asuna is lovely.</quote>

  <summary>Based on a 1967 children's book by British writer Joan G. Robinson. Anna (voiced by Sara Takatsuki), an unhappy 12-year-old orphan who calls her kindly adoptive mother &quot;aunt,&quot; and Marnie (Kasumi Arimura), an outgoing, if mysterious, blonde-haired girl become friends while Anna is spending a summer on the Hokkaido coast with her mother's relatives.

It quickly becomes apparent, however, that Marnie is not what she seems and that the story will be more than an ode to budding female friendship. (japantimes.co.jp)</summary>
  <quote>It's a perfectly acceptable movie, but didn't meet the standard we have come to expect from Ghibli. Typical complaints include a lack of fantastical elements &amp;amp; whimsy in exchange for quieter, character-based story telling. The story is good though, &amp;amp; while Anna isn't the most endearing lead, it's nice to see her grow. Admittedly, I was a bit exhausted on my initial watch, but by the end I felt overwhelmed with emotions, thinking about my own family. So this could be very personal for others too.</quote>

  <quote>OK, so the Spider-Man part of the movie is great. Garfield is fit to play this role. He and Emma have undeniable chemistry too, which makes the development of their relationship all the more touching. However, as has always been my personal issue with the franchise, the numerous villains feel rushed and their motivations are weak. Foxx does decently with his role, but they should have put more focus on him &amp;amp; left the Harry plot to heat up on the back-burner until the next film. Still enjoyable.</quote>

  <quote>The extended cut makes it a bit more comprehensible and includes polished fight scenes; the final battle between Cloud and Sephiroth is one of the most technically brilliant sword fights I've seen. Sadly, the story pales in comparison (pointless arc) to the epic journey of the game and most fans, myself included, continue to wish for an anime adaptation or PS3 re-make. This is a technological showcase however, and it certainly is pretty. It was nice to see characters I love again. That's all.</quote>

The Julia Child back story is much more interesting and Streep's chemistry with Stanley Tucci is as genuine as movie relationships can get. The legacy of this movie will be the delicate balance of expectation/reality that Streep gives to the life of a cultural icon.</quote>

  <quote>Hughes always had a knack for honest storytelling and this script definitely doesn't shy away from reality or the big questions. Do young men really want to get married? What does it mean to be happy? The main complaint I have about the movie is Kristy; she's not a very fleshed out character and I didn't really feel much of a connection with her. That said- this is Kevin Bacon's movie and he doesn't disappoint.</quote>

  <quote>Though its been called a film that can appeal to both fans and those with no prior experience with the Star Trek universe, most of the fun comes from in-jokes and homage to the original series.  The first half of the film excels, but the villain really lets us down.  Once the characters are set, the story is fairly straight forward, predictable and unexceptional in the intellectual department.  Based off a series featuring such smart storytelling; one can't help but be a little disappointed.</quote>

  <summary>New York, 1959. Max Bialystock was once the king of Broadway, but now all his shows close on opening night. Things turn around when he's visited by the neurotic accountant Leo Bloom, who proposes a scheme tailor-made for producers who can only make flops: raise far more money than you need, then make sure the show is despised. No one will be interested in it, so you can pocket the surplus. To this end, they produce a musical called Springtime for Hitler written by escaped Nazi Franz Liebken... (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>Not nearly as bad as expected based on critical reviews, but I do recognize the underdeveloped script. A proper sequel could handle many plot issues, if we see one. The positive takeaways: it's a gorgeous film and Scott's direction is phenomenal. Set designs and special effects are some of the best in years and I loved the homages to the original Alien film. The ending does leave some questions unanswered though and that's a disappointment, but it's an exciting sci-fi horror romp nonetheless.</quote>

  <quote>I really enjoyed Hepburn's performance, but she seemed like a smoldering supernova among co-starring bags of sand. Nothing happened that captivated me and there's not much of a cohesive narrative. I suppose this could be a jabbing comment on the New York lifestyle in general, but it doesn't leave me wanting to see it again anytime soon. Positives include the soundtrack and some of the camera work, but it's easy to see why Audrey's iconic debutante image is the only lasting cultural influence.</quote>

  <quote>A hypochondriac's nightmare! It does a tremendous job creating an atmosphere for a believable and realistic epidemic; but there's limited narrative outside of 'this is what would happen.' Damon's is the only character that we're given time to empathize with, making the scenes he and his daughter appear in the film's strongest. Still, where the film fails to connect with the audience emotionally, it emphatically promotes paranoia and will have everyone nervously reaching for the hand sanitizer.</quote>

  <summary>Buddy (Will Ferrell) was a baby in an orphanage who stowed away in Santa's sack and ended up at the North Pole. Later, as an adult human who happened to be raised by elves, Santa allows him to go to New York City to find his birth father, Walter Hobbs (James Caan). Hobbs, on Santa's naughty list for being a heartless jerk, had no idea that Buddy was even born. Buddy, meanwhile, experiences the delights of New York City (and human culture) as only an elf can. When Walter's relationship with Buddy interferes with his job, he is forced to reevaluate his priorities. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Ferrell's best venture into the realm of family films. It might actually be his best performance and, in reality, is a bit self-revealing. Aside from his ridiculous man-child display, Zooey is great, James Caan is an ideal casting to play Buddy's oft-irritated father and Bob Newhart is truly funny in his limited screen time. It's one of few modern additions to the list of Holiday Classics.</quote>

  <summary>Disgruntled Korean War vet Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) sets out to reform his neighbor, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.</summary>
  <quote>Eastwood is good as a disgruntled war vet, often proving awkwardly funny with his racist tirades. His directing is solid, very similar visually to &quot;Million $ Baby.&quot; The rest of the cast is mediocre though, save for the young girl next door. A few uneven scenes offset the overall pace, but the ending is pretty appropriate. However, five or six points get knocked off the overall score due to the badly timed and bizarre inclusion of Eastwood singing a little farewell serenade as the credits start.</quote>

  <summary>Mysterious and powerful aliens launch an all-out invasion against the human race. The spectacle begins when massive spaceships appear in Earth's skies. But wonder turns to terror as the ships blast destructive beams of fire down on cities all over the planet. Now the world's only hope lies with a determined band of survivors, uniting for one last strike against the invaders - before it's the end of all mankind. (20th Century Fox)</summary>
  <quote>One of the quintessential summer blockbusters, pure silly popcorn entertainment from start to finish. It's an action-packed 90s version of War of the Worlds that promotes patriotism and global camaraderie against the alien invaders. This was the year Will Smith started his meteoric rise to film stardom and his charisma is contagious. Goldblum plays himself and Pullman's speech has become a classic scene; otherwise it's just a fun special effects showcase that should be enjoyed on large screens.</quote>

  <quote>Lacks a certain magic that made the first so great, but the acting is good and the first half excels. Technically, the visuals and sound are still incredible.  Rockwell's Hammer though, while a solid performance, was a bit too annoying and Rourke is tragically underused.  Even at 2 hours the film feels rushed. The ending was lacking development for all the plots:  It's like they raced to the final 15 minutes, shoved a bunch of explosions at the camera, then wrapped it all up with a little bow.</quote>

But she meets her match in Jamie (Gyllenhaal), whose relentless and nearly infallible charm serve him well with the ladies and in the cutthroat world of pharmaceutical sales. Maggie and Jamie's evolving relationship takes them both by surprise, as they find themselves under the influence of the ultimate drug: love. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Less comedy than previews would lead you to believe, but that's a good thing. While many films have similar plots and love story arcs, Jake and Anne have terrific chemistry which helps propel an above-average romantic drama. There are a few caricature issues with side characters, but the back-story of late 90's pharmaceutical culture gives this a gritty, realistic feel. Finally, Maggie's illness is more than just a film gimmick; its a real-world testing point for the unrivaled power of devotion.</quote>

  <quote>Really enjoyable comedy with a solid cast of voice actors (loved David Cross, especially). There are some touching moments and the story is fairly engaging, if not totally original (see Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog). The animation and use of color is fantastic in fast-moving scenes, though the character design outside of MegaMind is kind of weak. Ultimately, it's a quality animated family film that falls short of being a masterpiece, but has plenty of clever moments &amp;amp; never insults the viewer.</quote>

  <summary>Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England.</summary>
  <quote>With anyone else as Holmes this movie would have failed to hold my interest. RDJ's ability to balance charisma and charm with the analytic ticks and masterful sleuth skills of the famous detective bring the legend to life, but there is a lack of strong supporting characters. The story doesn't live up to the potential and the villain, though creepy, isn't particularly interesting. Style over substance, but fortunately Guy Ritchie's cinematography, music and slick action still make it a fun romp.</quote>

  <quote>Pure pro-American propaganda with a support-our-troops ribbon tacked right on the front. Still, the emotional power of Bacon's performance combined with the fact that this realistically depicts many American patriotic attitudes (at least in the rust belt or Red-State America), makes it a fitting tribute to the men &amp;amp; women who have served America and died fighting. For a more raw and meaningful portrayal of the effects of war-time on soldiers and their families see The Messenger, also from 2009.</quote>

  <quote>As has been the stigma; a charming film, but along with 'A Bug's Life' it's at the bottom of Pixar's impressive resume. It's outright a kid's flick as a comedy, lacking some of the tact and maturity viewers have come to expect from these filmmakers. As an homage to NASCAR and 50s Americana, it has an overly 'sponsored' feeling about it. Cameos are forced and add nothing to the story. Thankfully, it's a visual treat and a wholesome message about friendship and loyalty are its redeeming qualities.</quote>

In many ways, it also holds political commentary and speaks to the paranoia of the 1950s. The creative imagination in the scenery and technology on Altair is astounding, but the one thing that dates the movie is the excessive amount of technological explanation. Some things are better left fantastical.</quote>

  <summary>When Jay and Silent Bob learn that a &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; movie is being made featuring their comic book counterparts, they drool at the thought of fat movie checks rolling in. But when the pair finds that there won't be any royalties coming their way, they set out to sabotage the flick at all costs.  (News Askew)</summary>
  <quote>Kevin Smith always seemed disappointed that many people loved the pothead jokes in his previous movies moreso than the dialogues on society and culture. All the same, the ever popular duo of Jay and Silent Bob were destined to have their own movie. You can take it or leave it from the ViewAskewniverse, but when I was 15 this movie seemed so darned funny. Looking back on it as an adult, I realize it's shallow and stupid. But it's still a stoner-fan favorite and that considered, a gift from Smith.</quote>

  <quote>Impeccably designed and masterfully filmed, it inserts some seemingly fresh ideas into mainstream sci-fi and blockbuster films. Unfortunately, those ideas that may seem new to the general movie-going population are actually borrowed from a gamut of this film's genre elders. As not to spoil the plot I'll hold back on name dropping movies this one borrows from, but there are quite a few. It's still worth a view though for the outstanding visuals, soundtrack, and Tom Cruise's fine performance.</quote>

  <summary>The magically long-haired Rapunzel has spent her entire life in a tower, but now that a runaway thief has stumbled upon her, she is about to discover the world for the first time, and who she really is.</summary>
  <quote>Tangled is beautifully animated and often funny. The relationship between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel is frightening in its potential realism. The film suffers, however, when compared to other Disney classics as it borrows heavily from The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. Even the Oscar nominated song sounds a lot like &quot;A Whole New World.&quot; The ending impressed though, coming off much darker than I expected. Ultimately, compared to Pixar and even the latest Dreamworks films, it didn't quite measure up.</quote>

  <quote>Charming Hemsworth seems suited for the titular role and provides the proper balance of arrogant prick/humbled hero. There are moments of great action and sharp humor but the supporting cast falters. Portman is surprisingly disappointing, Thor's loyalists and Dennings prove little more than comic relief and the villains flicker with promise before wilting into tired cliches. The creation of Asgard is breathtaking however and the visuals alone make this worth a view before 'Avengers' comes out.</quote>

  <quote>It's a clinic on 'How to make a Spielberg epic:' There's sweeping cinematic shots and brilliant lighting. John Williams' score is sublime (if occasionally corny). It's beautiful, no doubt! However, this movies confuses me; It's obviously intended to be a children's movie about horses and bravery (forgivable), but the WWI subject matter, a few chilling scenes and a PG-13 rating make it a bit too much for younger viewers. Essentially it's a live-action Disney war movie for teens who love animals.</quote>

  <quote>Most of the characters are derivative and the plot lacks some of the thrill needed for the genre. Grint seems almost like an afterthought and Blunt is a tad boorish, despite her character's quirks. However, the restraint in Nighy's performance showcases a graceful strength that gives the film it's charm. His hitman expertise and attention to detail (mixed with anti-social tendencies) lend to an exhibition that could be described as a light, humorous deconstruction of Léon from The Professional.</quote>

  <quote>My initial reaction was disappointment. My personal taste suggests I would be a big fan, but I did not care for the direction or editing. The characters came off as annoying, making it hard to appreciate their cultural infamy. This will probably be a movie I appreciate for its cultural value, and the fact that it challenged censorship, but compared stylistically to a movie like the Godfather that came out only 5 years later, it hasn't aged well.</quote>

  <quote>A little tree-hugging film for the kiddies. The environmental message is a little heavy, but for the time it wasn't overdone. It helps kids see the magic of the rainforest and contemplate nature in a way they typically wouldn't. The main characters are filled with sexual tension, which is kind of weird for a kid's movie, and Robin Williams and Tim Curry each lend their boisterous  voices to interesting supporting characters. The storyline is often cited as the prototype to the plot of Avatar.</quote>

  <summary>The touching story of how Santa Claus came to be Santa.</summary>
  <quote>This is a fantastic story and a wonder to look at. The music and cinematography are amazing for a low budget family film.  It's a great message for young children and those who are beginning to question the true nature of Santa Claus. It certainly inspires the Christmas spirit and the desire to give.  Do your darndest to see the original language version though, because the English dub is pretty bad.  It doesn't ruin the movie, but it certainly distracts!</quote>

  <quote>It's definitely a comedy classic and on its own it's worth a higher score. But unfortunately for me, I heard this movie quoted millions of times before I ever saw it and it ruined the experience. I was a sad panda. Take it from someone who suffered the Holy Grail curse: if you love this movie and want someone else to enjoy it, don't let them watch it with a group of rabid fans who hammer infamous lines to death or like to run around Wal-Mart acting like they have coconuts in their hands.</quote>

  <quote>Ultimately a kids movie, with a few surprisingly dark moments considering. It's fun and well acted. Observing the &quot;civilian&quot; side of a massive superhero universe is clever, taking into account social media, merchandising, and public opinion of supers. The moments where Shazam! and Freddy explore the newfound privileges of adulthood are funny, but one can't help imagine what this movie could have been given the Deadpool treatment. Still, this is a family-friendly affair with good feels.</quote>

  <quote>It's a good movie, I just have a hard time seeing Ehrenreich as Han Solo so there's a struggle at suspending belief sometimes. Honestly, I think a problem with some of the casting in new Star Wars movies is that there are so many big names. It makes it more obvious that we're watching people performing in a Star Wars movie, rather than buying into an experience inside the Star Wars universe.</quote>

  <summary>September 11, 2001 was an unusually warm day in New York. Will Jimeno, an officer with the Port Authority Police Department, was tempted to take a personal day to enjoy his hobby of bow hunting, but ultimately decided that he would go to work. Sergeant John McLoughlin, a respected veteran of the PAPD, had been up for hours -- a requirement of his daily, 1½-hour trek to the city. They and their colleagues made their way to midtown Manhattan, just like they did any other day. Only this wasn't any other day.  (Paramount)</summary>

  <summary>A musical inspired on Beatles's songs. A dock worker Jude (Jim Sturgess) travels to America in the 1960s to find his estranged father. There he falls in love with sheltered American teenager Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). When her brother Max (Joe Anderson) is drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, they become involved in peace activism. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I'm always a bit leery of musicals that try to work songs into plot &amp;amp; dialogue, rather than letting the musical numbers stand on their own. There are entertaining covers to be had here, but ultimately none of the songs are as good as the originals (how could they be?) The plot seems heavily tacked on and serves only to fit another song in. I give it credit for the colorful style, but boo to obvious references. Time would be better spent listening to actual Beatles albums and painting on canvas.</quote>

  <summary>The Science of Sleep is a playful romantic fantasy set inside the topsy-turvy brain of Stephane Miroux (Bernal) an eccentric young man whose dreams constantly invade his waking life.  (Warner Independent Pictures)</summary>
  <quote>The visual style and creativity of this movie is brilliant, but I feel that I was let down by false advertising. I would not call this a &quot;playful romantic fantasy,&quot; because it's not really very romantic. It's hard to find a likable character, and though Bernal and Gainsbourg perform well, I just didn't like their chemistry or attitudes. I kept thinking about how I would have done this movie differently &amp;amp; by the end I was just frustrated. The last 2 minutes help a bit, but don't redeem it for me.</quote>

  <quote>The animation is interesting, if not always pretty, and the music is great. The story is a fairly generic heist plot, but is entertaining enough for younger viewers. Numerous references to classic crime dramas (Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, To Catch a Thief &amp;amp; others) make it fun for adults as well, but there's little-to-no rewatch value. The main trio (jewel thief, Zoe &amp;amp; the cat) are the only interesting characters. Still worth a view on a rainy afternoon, considering it's only 70 minutes long.</quote>

  <quote>Follows the Simpsons mold with added vulgarity and frequent flashback/cutaway scenes. General consensus is that the first few seasons were pretty funny, with sharp pop culture references mixed into legitimate episode plots. Brian and Stewie were highlights. Show was cancelled, brought back due to DVD sales and performance on late night TV, and then the quality of episodes slowly trailed off until it became the type of show where it just throws random jokes at you until one makes you chuckle.</quote>

  <summary>Walt Koontz, a homophobic guy, ends up with paralyzed vocal cords because of an unfortunate stroke. His therapy includes receiving singing lessons from a neighbor who is not only openly flamboyant but also a pre-op transgenderist. Both of them are equally prejudiced; Koontz against homosexuals and the neighbor against close-minded straight people. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Hoffman and De Niro make the most out of cliche characters (Hoffman's performance is especially good), but the plot is very simple. The best scenes are the ones that focus on the Walt/Rusty relationship and show these people gaining an understanding of one another. There are some funny exchanges scattered among the serious story of a crime-ridden apartment complex, and some entertaining, over-the-top moments featuring Rusty's wild band of Drag Queens. Worth a watch for fans of actors involved.</quote>

  <summary>Magic-- A century has passed since this concept has been recognized as a formal technology instead of the product of the occult or folklore. The season is spring and it is time for a brand new school year.</summary>
  <quote>This is a super interesting concept and the animation is gorgeous. The downside is that the story drags a bit (overly explanatory scenes about tech and high school bureaucracy), and there's some weird incesty-stuff going on. However, that might be explained more in episodes available beyond the time of this writing.</quote>

  <quote>Went in with low expectations: Cavill seems a good fit for the title role as an anonymous do-gooder who can't reveal his identity for fear of crippling mankind with the burden of his existence. Decent flashback scenes with Costner help an OK script, though it's underdeveloped. Side characters get little back-story, yet we're supposed to care about them. With lots of Christ imagery and a borrowed visual style of JJ Abrams or Ridley Scott's Alien films, it's lively but has little re-watch value.</quote>

  <quote>Kind of plods along for about 75% of the run time and the characters, especially the children, are such 'family film' stereotypes. Wilson and Aniston are OK, but the greatest draw of the film is Marley and he certainly reaches for our hearts - especially if you're an animal/dog owner. In a loving atmosphere, pets really do become a part of the family who can enrich our lives. That's the simple message of the film. Nothing more substantial, but the final half hour does make this worth watching.</quote>

  <quote>Yes, it's rough and has Jar Jar. When compared to parts of A New Hope, however, there are moments of cheese that stand out in both. Lucas has never been very good at dialogue. I can actually stand this for what it is (an over-blown action movie) and I guess I have fond memories of it because it was the first Star Wars I saw in theaters. Neeson brings quiet strength to Qui-Gon's characer and the much-maligned special effects are actually very impressive. If only a different kid had played Anakin.</quote>

  <summary>The third installment in Michael Bay's trilogy travels back to 1969's historic moon landing, when Neil Armstrong and his Apollo 11 cohorts touch down in the Sea of Tranquility ... and discover what appears to be a downed Transformers craft. Flash forward to the present, and the Decepticons are ready to exact revenge on Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots. Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky, the Autobots' human ally.</summary>
  <quote>How you feel about Shia will dictate a majority of your opinion about these films. I like him as the lead, but there's only so much script to work with. There was nearly a great movie buried beneath the bloated, pro-military hooplah and corny one-liners. The pluses; Malkovich and Tudyk are fine comedy additions and the visuals are the best of the trilogy (clear and discernible). The scenes of devastation in Chicago had me hopeful for a great climax, but the explosions went overboard for 30 min.</quote>

But when Coach Klein (Winkler) makes the call that allows Bobby to finally stand up for himself, it unleashes a torrent of bottled-up frustration ... and exposes a talent for tackling that transforms him from a meek &amp;amp;#034;water distribution engineer&amp;amp;#034; into the hardest hitter ever to roam the gridiron!

  <quote>I never expected much of this movie. I figured it was just a retread of the ideas covered in films like Big, Freaky Friday or even It's a Wonderful Life. Additionally, I hadn't given a second thought to Efron after HSM. However, the acting is really good for this type of film, the script is full of funny dialogue and there are lots of uncomfortable topics that a weaker movie would have avoided. Moments with Efron &amp;amp; Mann in particular are hilariously awkward as is the Lennon/Hardin relationship.</quote>

The film itself is fair enough and has some sure-fire tear-jerk moments (if you allow yourself to experience those feelings), but I'll always think of it fondly mostly due to my Grandma. For many people the songs are sappy and cheesy, but they really get to me just because of the association.</quote>

  <quote>Disappointing. The story was nothing exceptional &amp;amp; the characters had rushed/incomplete development. Everything seemed so very out of control and stitched together; the trolls were especially awkward and the music was catchy, but uninspired. The positives include beautiful and imaginative graphics, a handful of amusing moments with the snowman &amp;amp; reindeer and a couple decent twists on fairy tail expectations. Kids will love it, but those raised on classic Disney will notice something missing.</quote>

  <quote>A weird, dirty and sweaty post-apocalyptic romp with Mel and the Lost Children. There's some cool action here and a few good characters and quotes, but it gets a little too campy in the second half. A letdown after the swift action of the first two films. Still, go in with low expectations and you'll have a good time.</quote>

  <summary>An inspiring look at JK Rowling's rise to become one of the most influential writers-from her humble beginnings as an imaginative young girl and awkward teenager to the loss of her mother and the genesis of the Harry Potter phenomenon.</summary>
  <quote>Obviously a made-for-TV style presentation of Rowling's life, but there are charming moments.  It would be wonderful to see a fully-realized telling of her story, with more insight into how she came up with the world of Harry Potter, but this bare-bones story of her important life events really serves as an inspiration to anyone who wants to be a writer or has been told they need to have a &quot;practical&quot; career. At the end, I felt ready to go start writing myself.</quote>

  <summary>An adaptation of the successful stage musical based on Victor Hugo's classic novel set in 19th-century France, in which a paroled prisoner named Jean Valjean seeks redemption. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Despite a grand scope and impressive sets, the musical fails to translate to the screen without some serious problems. First and foremost: whereas characters can sing their stories to an audience on the stage, the constant interaction of film characters through song (even for minuscule, less important dialogue) is monotonous to the point that it becomes comical. And it takes away from the big numbers that are performed admirably! Also, fine actors aside, Crowe and Jackman are not great singers.</quote>

  <summary>When a shoulder injury ended his minor league pitching career twelve years ago, Jim Morris resorted to the next best thing: coaching. But Jim's team, knowing their coach is a great ball player, makes a deal with him: if they win the district championship, they want Jim to try out for a major-league organization. Going from worst to first, the team makes it to state, and Jim is forced to live up to his end of the deal. While there prove to be a lot of pitches to be thrown before he makes it off the mound, big-league dreams are revived, and there's no telling where he could go. (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>Certainly a realistic depiction of how overwhelming a global zombie apocalypse could be, but much like Contagion, it presents more possibilities than answers. The problem is, the zombie genre is way too saturated and we've seen all this before. Plenty of action and frightening zombies, but nothing new/innovative. Visually, it's dark and full of unnecessary shaky cam. The best moments are when the camera pans back for the dramatic scenes of city-wide destruction. Worth a view for apocalypse fans.</quote>

  <quote>I actually enjoyed it alot more than the first, especially because you could tell what was actually happening on the screen this time.  The first had close-up after close-up of robots wrestling; &quot;Revenge&quot; pulled back the view a little and let you see the battles - which there were plenty of.  Shia is definitely the main reason for anyone seeing the film, so long as you enjoy his quirky eccentricies.  The story, again, isn't much - but I didn't feel as empty leaving the theater as two years ago.</quote>

  <quote>This is on cable TV about as much as any other movie (except maybe Road House). The premise is entirely cheesy and the movie itself borders dangerously on misogynistic ideals...  but darn if Kurt &amp;amp; Goldie don't have the best chemistry! The dialogue is actually pretty clever and the conclusion is delightful fun. I've seen numerous single women of various ages refer to this as their favorite movie, so take that for what it's worth.</quote>

  <quote>Honestly presents the overly-emotional turmoil that exists in the friendships of many young women, while occasionally grazing the area of sexist stereotypes. However, it discusses things such as self-esteem, sexuality and even mortality in ways that many films aimed at this target audience tend to avoid. Less focus on each girl's relationship with boys would benefit the script and help establish each character's individuality, but I guess the need for a boyfriend is an examinable subject itself.</quote>

  <summary>Lt. Caleb Holt lives by the old firefighter's adage: Never leave your partner behind. Inside burning buildings, it's his natural instinct. In the cooling embers of his marriage, it's another story.</summary>
  <quote>A solid Christian film, which is recommendable to newly weds or those who feel their marriage may be suffering.  Though its message is about learning to love through accepting faith into your life, it doesn't tell its viewers that its necessary to go to Church or portray those who don't believe as entirely evil.  (If only more diehard Christians were like this.)      The quality of filmmaking is more like a made-for-TV movie and the acting is suspect; but Kirk Cameron's performance is admirable.</quote>

  <quote>Sure this movie is bad, but it's the height of mindless entertainment! The cast is great and there's lots of cheesy one-liners among the physical and non-sensical mayhem. Like every other Bay film, it takes itself way too seriously and acts like their is some kind of important message to relay, but the main group of characters has a ball with this. Willis and Buscemi in particular are great. Everything is forced, staged, and filled with over-the-top emotional schlop, but unapologetically so.</quote>

  <quote>Has some truly hilarious moments and over-the-top gore. This movie is almost necessary though, considering New Zealand's huge sheep population as a subject of constant cultural jokes. It had many laughs for me personally because my grandparents have a sheep farm, but I could see this becoming quite terrifying for someone who lives in an area with lots of sheep. Generally though, it's fairly repetitive and disgusting and doesn't offer any insightful parody beyond the physical comedy. Dumb fun.</quote>

  <summary>Having been revived at the hospital, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to meet more victims. However, this time has he met his match in Tommy Jarvis ? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>First off, yes, the title is a lie because there were about six more of these movies made. As far as slashers go, most of the Fri.13 movies blend together a bunch of violence with teenage sexual tension and this one isn't really an exception, BUT! You've got Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover (who introduces his infamous spaz-dance). This is probably the most out-right entertaining of the bunch and the best besides the original. If you're going to have a Friday night marathon, skip parts 2 &amp;amp; 3.</quote>

  <quote>Very disappointing effort from Woody.  Decent premise, it just never hits a stride. The physical comedy is fair at best. He, the camera man, and Debra Messing were the only characters I liked.  I've never been able to warm up to Téa Leoni... or maybe it's just the haircut?  Either way, a few chuckles but overall it's an unforgettable miss-fire among the many great scripts Woody has produced over the years.</quote>

Transformed into a superhero named Captain America, Steve goes after the Axis. With his perfect physique and heightened reflexes -- and his sidekick, Bucky (Sebastian Stan) -- Steve battles the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), a super soldier created by Italian fascists.</summary>
  <quote>For red-blooded American men between the age of 25 &amp;amp; 60, or those who loved the comic in their youth. The sum of its parts is greater than the whole - Evans, Weaving and TLJ all do very well with little script. Propaganda scenes were fun, but the plot is predictable superhero fodder after half-way point. Every war scene is filled with conveniently placed explosions or cliche nick-of-time &quot;good guy arrivals.&quot; Effects and visuals are slick, but boring. Feels like a long lead-in to The Avengers.</quote>

  <quote>It's an 80s action film with a good plot about immortality and love, but horrible special effects and acting.  The lone star in the film is the villian, who is a mean, disgusting and overly violent monster of a man. I have no interest in watching this particular film again, but if there's any movie that could use a well-funded and well-produced remake, I would say this is it. So much potential.</quote>

  <quote>As far as sports comedies go, you can certainly do worse. It's essentially 'Angels in the Outfield' with an 'urban' basketball twist. The first half hour has some genuine heartfelt moments when dealing with Antoine's passing and then when his ghost returns to help the team, things get pretty wacky. I enjoyed it as a kid, especially as a Seattle Sonics/Washington Huskies fan.</quote>

Suddenly, gunfire cuts down a ringside government official, and 14,000 fans suddenly become 14,000 suspects. What eyewitnesses saw, what a casino-wide spycam network reveals and what a mysterious woman in white knows--all lead to a shattering truth Santoro does not want to believe. (Paramount)</summary>

  <summary>From the creators of Shrek comes the most smart, funny, irreverent animated comedy of the year, DreamWorks' Trolls. This holiday season, enter a colorful, wondrous world populated by hilariously unforgettable characters and discover the story of the overly optimistic Trolls, with a constant song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomach.</summary>
  <quote>Based on trailers I was expecting this to be horrible, point-blank. But it's actually quite entertaining, if not totally ridiculous. Fun songs and lots of bright colors kept my young boys interested.</quote>

  <quote>Some will argue that it's a more faithful adaptation of the book than the 1971 film, but when it's such a mediocre movie that fails to matter. As great an actor as Depp is, he just can't hold a candle to the simmering brilliance of Gene Wilder's bizarre minimalist performance as Wonka. It's got some interesting visuals, to be sure, and Freddie Highmore is great as Charlie, but everything is done so deliberately to avoid replicating the earlier film that it fails to leave a positive impression.</quote>

  <summary>A dinosaur gets separated from his family, and attempts to find his way home.  He meets a human boy along the way, and the two work together to brave the elements.</summary>
  <quote>The first Pixar movie I am outright disappointed with, but the landscapes are gorgeous. They look like high-definition real-life images. The dinosaur designs are atrocious though. I guess I understand making them unique for marketing purposes, but they just look ugly and fake! Sam Elliott's casting was inspired, but there are too many scenes and ideas borrowed from previous Disney movies; especially Lion King. Arlo's not the most likable character, and the humans as dogs bit was pretty lame.</quote>

  <quote>Cinema_Asia's review is so spot on that I can't really say much more.

Judge completely abandons the subtlety of his brilliant comedies like King of the Hill and Office Space and lets the world this film exists in overtake the narrative. Instead of poking fun at the brainless society-to-be, we are constantly annoyed by the inhabitants. We see enough of this in every day life that it's not enjoyable on film. That could be the point, but better handling of the satire could have been hilarious.</quote>

(imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Despite an enormous world to explore, it feels like we don't see much of it.  There were too many plot lines and a lack of consistency; even with character personalities. The dinosaurs are cool, and the nostalgia nods were nice, sure, but I'd just rather watch the original JP a dozen times. Direction was lacking. Everything feels forced, like a hollow, corporate-sponsored set up for a sequel, even though the premise is exhausted now. But a $$ record breaking opening means another 'must be made.'</quote>

  <quote>Script is pretty bad &amp;amp; the dialogue is useless, but there's some interesting ideas going on here. They should have fully embraced the potential for PG-13, or otherwise made it more kid friendly because it gets lost in a weird middle place. Some genuinely dark and scary moments (featuring solid CGI &amp;amp; character design) can't save characters that are supremely underdeveloped. Lerman, who is very talented, is not used to his potential. There is hope for the franchise but better direction is needed.</quote>

  <quote>The story is only mildly interesting in that it offers a view into the expected social roles of single 20-something working women in the 1950s.

I didn't feel much chemistry with the paired couples and was a bit put off by the dating and seduction techniques that they all used.  I will note that the title song is lovely.</quote>

  <quote>Overall, good sentiments and lessons--it has energy that makes you want to root for the 'good girl' and see her get revenge for years of being mistreated/bullied, etc, but ends up putting the audience in front of a mirror. Should we want revenge? Does negative energy end up shaping who we are? Acting is spotty, but sophisticated for a Disney Channel movie and, as long as they watch the whole movie, it teaches kids to appreciate what they have instead of being defined by materials and popularity.</quote>

  <quote>Spacey is good as usual and there is a little bit of interest generated by the 'true story' angle, but none of the characters are very sympathetic. There are a number awful montages and the story arch is as predictable as any Hollywood script. Nerd abandons his friends for the promise of wealth and fame: &quot;Money, girls, high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas, double-cross, yeaaaaah!&quot; A few extra points for the final chase scene in the Casino, which is filmed well.</quote>

Instead, she finds herself in the middle of a series of increasingly nightmarish acts that even her father David cannot stop. Who--or what--is Charlie?! David wonders. How can an...&quot;imaginary&quot; entity have this kind of hold on her? Maybe Charlie is not imaginary at all, but instead a flesh-and-blood, malevolent presence? (imdb)</summary>

Writer/director Steve Oedekerk uses contemporary characters and splices them into a 1970s kung-fu film, weaving the new and old together. As the main character, The Chosen One, Oedekerk sets off to avenge the deaths of his parents at the hands of kung-fu legend Master Pain. Along the way, he encounters some strange characters, one of which is a cow trained in the martial arts. (imdb)</summary>

But that's before Pam's parents meet Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz Focker (Hoffman and Streisand). The hyper-relaxed Fockers and the tightly-wound Byrneses are woefully mismatched from the start, and no matter how hard Greg and Pam try, there is just no bringing their families together-which all adds up to a disastrously funny time of &quot;getting to know you.&quot;  (Universal)</summary>

This movie will always be remembered for the outrageously &quot;funky&quot; (awkward) rap battle and tons of 80s-riffic pop songs. There are so many tunes it's practically a musical. It's one of those things that's best to watch with a group of people and play a drinking game while poking fun at it. Take a shot every time there's a weirdly-placed music number or a close-up on Louise's legs! Not a classic, but gets points for dumb fun and sexy redhead Robyn Lively.</quote>

  <quote>A few flares of interesting visual techniques and flawless animation can not save a stale story with recycled jokes and a phoned-in ending. Puss's back-story provides for some intrigue and extra-cute moments of him as a kitten, but the writers abandoned the swash-buckling heroics for a silly adventure with Humpty Dumpty that seems to be designed with a theme park ride in mind. Random music and dance numbers add nothing and the dialogue is ridiculously lazy. Totally fails to reach its potential.</quote>

  <quote>Extremely dated thanks to the ridiculous rap sessions and funky clothes, but it does have some amusing moments. Whoopi has the right attitude that makes you want to see her give guidance to these troubled kids. Of course it's cliche and absolutely over-the-top; the sass in this movie is almost enough to choke the viewer. A couple characters have some unique characteristics, but overall there's little development. I personally give more points because the music is decent and I love Lauryn Hill.</quote>

  <summary>A dream vacation that turns into a tropical nightmare. A gruff, rough-hewn cargo pilot living in the islands, Quinn Harris (Ford) hates tourists ... though he&amp;amp;#039;s not above making a fast buck from a sharp-tongued New Yorker, Robin Monroe (Heche), when she&amp;amp;#039;s desperate for a quick flight to Tahiti. But this already uneasy relationship suddenly takes a nosedive when his weather-beaten old plane is forced down in a storm, stranding the duo. (Buena Vista)</summary>

  <summary>Two spoiled guys (Ferrell and Reilly) become competitive stepbrothers after their single parents get hitched.</summary>
  <quote>The content promised so much more and I was lead to believe this was one of the funniest movies I'd ever see. There were a few chuckles, but I was completely underwhelmed. Reilly is the lone star here, I believe. Ferrell's performance just didn't deliver the punch I expected and most lines felt constantly forced and uncomfortable. Predictable, crude and dumb. With the exception of Reilly and Mary Steenburgen, all parties were trying too hard to force the funny instead of just letting it happen.</quote>

  <quote>Here is the stinker of the whole bunch. A mess of a script with horrible dialogue. There are some interesting ideas, especially in the second half, but those ideas are primarily stylistic endeavors. Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee give the only decent performances, yet they can't inject any life into the muddled, masochistic narrative. Hayden Christensen is an abomination, yet I have my doubts that even Leo DiCaprio (who was approached with the role) would have been able to perform this tripe.</quote>

  <quote>The script is awful and full of raunch, the premise ridiculous. Butler and Heigl have decent enough comedic timing to take it to a level closer to &quot;Knocked Up&quot; than most rom-coms, but it's still fairly forgettable. Worth a rent on a quiet evening, even if to just check out the gag reel which has funnier ad-libbed lines than the actual movie. Then again, you can probably find that on YouTube... Ah yes, here it is:

  <quote>'Film critic Kale Klein of the Carlsbad Current-Argus was so physically distressed by the film that he actually vomited during the initial screenings...' per Wikipedia. Hey man, this movie was cool when I was a kid! Obviously it's a rip-off of TMNT and Power Rangers but at the time I admired the idea of virtue and respect in warrior culture. As an adult, I can see clearly it's an awful movie &amp;amp; it's apparent why it bombed horribly at the box office. Good lessons, very poor execution and acting.</quote>

  <quote>American remakes of British films are often unnecessary, but in some cases they at least attempt to add a unique flair that makes it worth seeing... This is not one of those movies. It's a scene-by-scene reproduction of a movie that came out only three years before it; the only change being that we now have a mixed ethnic group speaking dumbed-down dialogue for an American audience. The weirdest part may be Peter Dinklage playing the exact same role as in the original. Very lazy filmmaking.</quote>

  <summary>Intrigued by the notion of taking an intact, undeniable classic and seeing what would happen if it were made again - with a nearly identical shooting script - but with contemporary filmmaking techniques, Gus Van Sant recreates the motion picture Psycho.  (Universal Studios)</summary>
  <quote>I actually saw a few bits of this one before seeing the original, and I thought William H. Macy and Julianne Moore did well with their roles... but then I watched Hitchcock's masterpiece from start to finish and realized just how silly it is that this even exists.  I do believe Van Sant could have made this film his own and done a good job... but as someone else has suggested, I kind of feel like this is an &quot;anti-remake&quot; remake - As if he made the film as an example of why not to touch classics.</quote>

  <quote>Concept, concept... failed execution. It does pose a few good questions about human nature, but it abandons the social commentary for easy scares and violent shoot-outs. Home invasion movies will still remain a bit creepy so long as you're watching them in your house, but that's not a past-time I regularly indulge in. The Hunger Games is a much better imagination of this type of dystopian world where violence is a government mandate and it's far more believable. Avoid.</quote>

  <quote>As usual with any Final Fantasy related film, it's style over substance. The fights look amazing, the creature designs and world are breathtaking, but the plot and characters are so bland. I played and beat the game (which I loved) before seeing this, so there were a few things I enjoyed seeing and noted as relevant, but mostly this comes across as shallow and unnecessary. Someone noted that the animation was done before the dub, and that is a bit distracting too. So much potential unrealized.</quote>

  <quote>An animation experiment, but one that rips off the character traits of a bunch of other studios in less than 2 minutes.  Disney hands, Goofy's trademark scream, Bugs Bunny's eyebrow shrug...  These characters offer nothing of interest and come off as irritating. The trees look good and the initial pan-down is impressive considering the date - but the rest is forgettable. Thankfully Pixar's narrative strength and animation style would develop far beyond these 'humble' beginnings.</quote>

  <summary>When Shelly, a Playboy bunny, is tossed out of the mansion, she has nowhere to go until she falls in with the sorority girls from Zeta Alpha Zeta. The members of the sorority - who also have got to be the seven most socially clueless women on the planet - are about to lose their house. They need a dose of what only the eternally bubbly Shelley can provide... but they will each learn on their own to stop pretending to be what others want them to be and start being themselves.</summary>

  <summary>Based upon Tyler Perry&amp;amp;#039;s acclaimed stage production, Madea&amp;amp;#039;s Family Reunion continues the adventures of southern matriarch Madea begun in the hit film Diary of a Mad Black Woman.  (Lionsgate)</summary>
  <quote>The story isn't as awful as the reputation would lead you to believe - it's a nice tale about overcoming abuse and learning to love and respect yourself - but the fact that Tyler Perry needs to dress up as Madea to further the &quot;sassy black grandma&quot; stereotype is always concerning. Nice to see some of the elders (including Maya Angelou, what?!) with reflections on society, but the repeated message of violent discipline combined with God's love is a cliche that can only go so far.</quote>

  <quote>The film that prepared Brendan Fraser for his iconic role as George of the Jungle. Honestly, this is one of Pauly Shore's more bearable movies because the concept is somewhat intriguing. Comedies that use ridiculous &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios are often mildly entertaining because they can make good use of slapstick physical comedy or super-awkward (zany!) situations. Unfortunately, Shore would jump on that bandwagon and run his career into the ground with multiple crap-fests after this became popular.</quote>

  <quote>Not nearly as much heart as the first movie and the novelty starts to wear off after a half-hour or so. One of those things that only exists to make money based on the success of the original. There is some interesting special effects, however, and I'm sure it was a blast making this. I doubt I'd ever sit down and choose to watch this, but if it were on TV I'd probably leave it on for a few minutes. Rich Moranis has a certain quirky charm and you can certainly do worse for family films.</quote>

  <quote>This could have been a smoldering, fun film had Cruz and Hayek been used to their full potential. Well, in a way I guess it's still sexy and special, but not how one would hope. The style is over-the-top; there's too many slow-motion, cliche-riddled fights and action sequences. Top it off with bad acting, cheap-looking costumes and makeup, plus awful accents apart from the two stars and you wind up with an unfocused mess. Should have been much better with the capable writers and cast involved.</quote>

  <quote>Not even my love of Jim Carrey and Drew Barrymore could make me want to watch this movie again. Even at 10 years old I could tell this was stupid. I love Batman, but after this and 'Batman &amp;amp; Robin,' my interest waned in the movie adaptations and I donated most of my Batman toys (a tad depressing in retrospect). Burton's films may have been campy, but Schumacher's are stale, humorless and idiotic. It's a real shame because this cast could have been great if they just dialed it down a little.</quote>

  <quote>An insult to everyone involved. These comedies that apply crude, modern-day humor (using that word loosely) to different time periods just don't translate. Could have been a funny short film concept, but as a full-length movie it suffocates under the weight of its own fecal matter. To those that imply that the cinematography and set pieces give this any value as some kind of self-aware comedy; picture a hot girl at a party who can't stop vomitting on herself. Visual flair can't overcome that.</quote>

Now Aang must join with his pal Katara (Nicola Peltz) and other allies to fulfill his destiny. M. Night Shyamalan directs this live-action adaptation of the animated series &quot;Avatar: The Last Airbender.&quot;</summary>
  <quote>It represents a sad betrayal of the terrific TV series. Shyamalan obviously tried to stay loyal to main points of the story, but craming all the &quot;dramatic&quot; points from 15+ hours of a tv show into a 1 1/2 hour movie? Bad idea. We lose all the essence of what made the characters great. Aang was decent but Katara and Sokka are completely &quot;white-washed,&quot; yes, a purposeful double entendre. By trying to fit so much stuff into the film, we end up having no character development or valuable content.</quote>

  <quote>This movie wanted so badly to have some kind of positive racial message, but the execution is simply horrific. The way humor is used here is pretty insulting. It reeks of the 80s even though it's a few years removed from the decade and there's little actual discussion about why race relations are so tense. Maybe it was assumed that people would just understand at the time it was released, but mostly it just makes Whoopi look &quot;aggressively angry.&quot; A little too white-saviory too.</quote>

  <quote>What a piece of flowery crap. I had minimal expectations based on the strong cast, but it quickly failed to impress on any level. I'm sure it was a blast to make, but it was hellish torture to watch. Honestly, I didn't even finish it. These films that try to build a story around an artist's catalog of greatest hits don't work unless they're an artistic concept piece. This just had a bunch of horrible camera work, a corny emotional schlop of a script and mixed results on the song presentations.</quote>

  <quote>There are some brutal and somewhat creative deaths for masochists (particularly the cable scene), but anyone looking for an interesting story or unique conclusion need not apply. There's nothing that appeals to any sense other than primal fear and sexual perversion, no real moments of psychological suspense; just recycled 'shock scenes' set to industrial rock music meant to make you jump out of your seat. I'm not a fan of horror/slasher films, so you can take my review with a grain of salt.</quote>

  <quote>Pure garbage. The main characters are hardly sympathetic &amp;amp; the plot makes zero sense, even for a kid's movie. After seeing it once, I would not subject my child to this forced &amp;amp; unnatural &quot;comedy&quot; ever again. It's a shame, because talent is involved. James Marsden does a bit with his underdeveloped character, but Russell's 'Brand' of humor just doesn't translate. Everyone else merely occupies space. Also, Fred's moment of realization is ridiculous &amp;amp; likining Easter to Christmas was a mistake.</quote>

  <quote>This has got to be bad on purpose. I mean... Robert Rodriguez is a fairly competent director, right? I groaned almost every time I saw a horrendously animated creature (and there are tons of them). And it's more than obvious that the actors are all standing against a green screen. There is nothing impressive about the visuals. None of the fight choreography is creative or believable. It's possible kids between 5 and 8 could find this entertaining, but I'd feel like a bad parent if my kid saw it.</quote>

  <quote>I enjoy the Holidays, but really don't care for these poorly made attempts at slapstick, feel-good Christmas stories. My wife says you have to lower the standard of expectation for movies like this, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a complete waste of time. There was maybe 1 chuckle-worthy moment in the whole movie, but everything else seemed like a failed attempt to recreate some kind of Christmas Vacation style humor. Total failure in every aspect and I will never watch it again.</quote>

  <quote>For completists only. This had to have been created as something else entirely and only had Star Wars slapped on it because of the Box Office success of the first movie. The characters don't have any resemblance to characters in the Star Wars universe, other than physically. For the first 15-20 minutes you might find it &quot;so bad it's hilarious,&quot; especially if you're watching it with a group, but before the half-way point (save for the cartoon) it becomes un-watchable and tedious beyond belief.</quote>

  <quote>It's well established that this story is basically an amalgamation of various fantasy/sci-fi stories that Paolini enjoyed as a kid, but the story isn't why this is bad. It's rushed. It's poorly edited. The sad thing is, there's good actors involved! There's no doubt this was thrown together in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity and success of the LOTR, but everything here is an absolute failure of, dare I say?  &quot;Epic&quot; proportions.</quote>

  <quote>'Boring' is such a boring word and usually implies that the viewer had a hard time paying attention to the movie. Not in this case. It's not a slow-burner that required the audience to focus, it's just a muddled sea of craptastic one-liners and awful effects. I get kind of itchy and hot around the neck just thinking about the blury/smokey visuals. Quite possibly the worst comic book movie I've ever seen and that's disappointing because the Rider has the potential to be a cool movie character.</quote>

  <quote>It's just disgusting and immature - little to no laughs, even when I was 16. Rob Schneider, much like Pauly Shore, should never be the lead in a film. For some reason there was a period of about 5 years at the turn of the century where a Schneider-driven 'comedy' would come out annually... Finally someone realized that he is barely tolerable in limited guest roles and so he returned to being Adam Sandler's annoying sidekick.</quote>

  <quote>Sometimes I wonder if Sandler is trolling in films like these. 'Punch Drunk Love,' 'Reign Over Me' and the second half of 'Click' proved that he can act if he makes the commitment. Does he have a gambling problem? He can't be hurting for money, can he? What boggles the mind even more is that Al Pacino is in this. Stuff like this should be reduced to 10 minute internet videos if actors need to experience cross-dressing and make vulgar/idiotic jokes. Thankfully, it barely made its budget back.</quote>

  <quote>I only watched this on late night TV as a basis for how excellent films can be by comparison. As advertised, it proved to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Perhaps something could be said for the minor commentary on animal abuse at the Zoo or the danger of materialism, but (just like any other message in the story) depth is lost in a wash of unfunny jokes and poor voice acting. This should appeal to no audience as even impressionable children may suffer developmentally if exposed to it.</quote>

  <quote>1 point for the fact that Santa has to get dramatically injected with a syringe to combat his allergic reaction to the kittens.</quote>

  <summary>Kevin McCallister&amp;amp;#039;s parents have split up. Now living with his mom, he decides to spend Christmas with his dad at the mansion of his father&amp;amp;#039;s rich girlfriend, Natalie. Meanwhile robber Marv Merchants, one of the villains from the first two movies, partners up with a new criminal named Vera to hit Natalie&amp;amp;#039;s mansion. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>At least 'Home Alone 3' had the decency to have a completely different character and unrelated events from the first two films. Was it good? No, but it wasn't a complete abortion of the franchise either. Apparently this was supposed to launch a TV series, which thankfully never saw light. Ugh. Why/How would Kevin be the same age?! Also French Stewart is worthless in movies. He is supposed to be Marv, originally played by Daniel Stern who turned down the reprise and called it &quot;an insult.&quot;</quote>

  <quote>No... You can't be serious. French Stewart takes the place of Matthew Broderick in a sequel to a movie that was horrible to begin with? I don't think I need to say any more.</quote>

  <quote>How do movies like this get green-lighted? I mean, honestly, who thinks sports movies starring animals are a good idea? 

At least with the Air Bud franchise you have some cute puppies who eventually start talking.</quote>

  <summary>A new fable for the hip hop age, where the best street dancers pit their moves and their passion for a chance to turn their talent into their dreams.  (Screen Gems)</summary>
  <quote>I contemplated giving this a couple of points because it resulted in a great episode of South Park... but then I realized that insightful spoof just furthered my opinion of how shitty this movie is. Leave the street dancing for the 3 minute music videos unless you can SOMEHOW come up with a decent plot with a little bit of realism to make us care about the characters and their backgrounds.</quote>
