## Review Classificiation

Finally, it is time to do a little classification modeling. The end goal here will be to see if we can correctly classify the reviews into the categories for each reviewer. 

Bucket Stuff:
    
    Justin:
    Horrific: 0 - 15
Bad: 16 - 34
Average: 35 - 69
Good: 70 - 79
Great: 80 - 89
Exceptional: 90 - 100

Zach:
    Horrible: 0 - 24
Bad: 25 - 49
Average: 50 - 69
Good: 70 - 79
Great: 80 - 89
Exceptional: 90 - 100


Tyler:
    Horrible: 0 - 24
Bad: 25 - 49
Average: 50 - 69
Good: 70 - 79

Exceptional: 90 - 100


This is how each reviewer categorizes their review score.
